## 背景      
  
primary node  
logical replication node  
  
如果在primary node有一个表, 表上有个触发器. 那么当数据复制到logical replication node时, 逻辑节点这个表上的触发器会不会被执行呢?  
  
答案是和触发器的设置、参数有关.   
  
如果使用的是内置的sub, pub方法进行订阅, 在逻辑复制的回放节点, 会话参数 session_replication_role=replica. 如果你在逻辑复制回放节点的trigger是默认方法创建的, 即没有指定REPLICA | ALWAYS, 那么这个trigger就不会触发.  
  
trigger = default , 只有当会话参数 session_replication_role=local, origin时 触发.   
trigger = REPLICA , 只有当会话参数 session_replication_role=replica时 触发.   
trigger = always , 任何时候都触发.   
  
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/sql-altertable.html  
  
```  
alter table  
  
DISABLE/ENABLE [ REPLICA | ALWAYS ] TRIGGER  
  
The trigger firing mechanism is also affected by the configuration variable session_replication_role.   
Simply enabled triggers (the default) will fire when the replication role is “origin” (the default) or “local”.   
Triggers configured as ENABLE REPLICA will only fire if the session is in “replica” mode,   
and triggers configured as ENABLE ALWAYS will fire regardless of the current replication role.  
  
The effect of this mechanism is that in the default configuration, triggers do not fire on replicas.   
This is useful because if a trigger is used on the origin to propagate data between tables,   
then the replication system will also replicate the propagated data, and the trigger should not fire a second time on the replica,   
because that would lead to duplication.   
  
However, if a trigger is used for another purpose such as creating external alerts,   
then it might be appropriate to set it to ENABLE ALWAYS so that it is also fired on replicas.  
```  
  
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-SESSION-REPLICATION-ROLE  
  
```  
session_replication_role (enum)  
Controls firing of replication-related triggers and rules for the current session.   
Setting this variable requires superuser privilege and results in discarding any previously cached query plans.   
Possible values are origin (the default), replica and local.  
  
The intended use of this setting is that logical replication systems set it to replica when they are applying replicated changes.   
The effect of that will be that triggers and rules (that have not been altered from their default configuration) will not fire on the replica.   
See the ALTER TABLE clauses ENABLE TRIGGER and ENABLE RULE for more information.  
  
PostgreSQL treats the settings origin and local the same internally.   
Third-party replication systems may use these two values for their internal purposes,   
for example using local to designate a session whose changes should not be replicated.  
  
Since foreign keys are implemented as triggers, setting this parameter to replica also disables all foreign key checks,   
which can leave data in an inconsistent state if improperly used.
