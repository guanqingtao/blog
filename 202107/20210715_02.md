## 背景

Too often, web tiers are full of boilerplate that does nothing except convert a result set into JSON. A middle tier could be as simple as a function call that returns JSON. All we need is an easy way to convert result sets into JSON in the database.  
  
PostgreSQL has built-in JSON generators that can be used to create structured JSON output right in the database, upping performance and radically simplifying web tiers.  
  
Fortunately, PostgreSQL has such functions, that run right next to the data, for better performance and lower bandwidth usage.  
  
## Some example data  
To try out these examples, load this tiny database:  
  
```  
CREATE TABLE employees (  
  employee_id serial primary key,  
  department_id integer references departments(department_id),  
  name text,   
  start_date date,   
  fingers integer,   
  geom geometry(point, 4326)  
  );  
  
CREATE TABLE departments (  
  department_id bigint primary key,  
  name text  
  );  
  
INSERT INTO departments   
 (department_id, name)  
VALUES   
 (1, 'spatial'),  
 (2, 'cloud');  
  
INSERT INTO employees   
 (department_id, name, start_date, fingers, geom)  
VALUES  
 (1, 'Paul',   '2018/09/02', 10, 'POINT(-123.32977 48.40732)'),  
 (1, 'Martin', '2019/09/02',  9, 'POINT(-123.32977 48.40732)'),  
 (2, 'Craig',  '2019/11/01', 10, 'POINT(-122.33207 47.60621)'),  
 (2, 'Dan',    '2020/10/01',  8, 'POINT(-122.33207 47.60621)');  
 ```  
  
Four employees, arranged into two departments, with some detail information about each employee.  
  
## Easy JSON using row_to_json  
The simplest JSON generator is row_to_json() which takes in a tuple value and returns the equivalent JSON dictionary.  
  
```  
SELECT row_to_json(employees)  
FROM employees  
WHERE employee_id = 1;  
```  
  
The resulting JSON uses the column names for keys, so you get a neat dictionary.  
  
```  
{  
  "employee_id": 1,  
  "department_id": 1,  
  "name": "Paul",  
  "start_date": "2018-09-02",  
  "fingers": 10,  
  "geom": {  
    "type": "Point",  
    "coordinates": [  
      -123.329773,  
      48.407326  
    ]  
  }  
}  
```  
  
And look what happens to the geometry column! Because PostGIS includes a cast from geometry to JSON, the geometry column is automatically mapped into GeoJSON in the conversion. This is a useful trick with any custom type: define a cast to JSON and you automatically integrate with the native PostgreSQL JSON generators.  
  
## Full result sets using json_agg  
Turning a single row into a dictionary is fine for basic record access, but queries frequently require multiple rows to be converted.  
  
Fortunately, there's an aggregate function for that, json_agg, which carries out the JSON conversion and converts the multiple results into a JSON list.  
  
```  
SELECT json_agg(e)   
FROM (  
    SELECT employee_id, name   
    FROM employees  
    WHERE department_id = 1  
    ) e;  
```  
  
Note that in order to strip down the data in the record, we use a subquery to make a narrower input to json_agg.  
  
```  
[  
  {  
    "employee_id": 1,  
    "name": "Paul"  
  },  
  {  
    "employee_id": 2,  
    "name": "Martin"  
  }  
]  
```  
  
## Nested results using subqueries  
So far, all this is pretty easy to replicate in middleware, but things get more interesting when you start dumping structured results.  
  
Using aggregation, and converting the results to JSON in stages, it's possible to build up nested JSON outputs that reflect table relationships.  
  
```  
WITH   
-- strip down employees table  
employees AS (  
  SELECT department_id, name, start_date  
  FROM employees  
),  
-- join to departments table and aggregate  
departments AS (  
  SELECT d.name AS department_name,   
         json_agg(e) AS employees  
  FROM departments d  
  JOIN employees e  
  USING (department_id)  
  GROUP BY d.name  
)  
-- output as one json list  
SELECT json_agg(departments)  
FROM departments;  
```  
  
And the result has one entry for each department, which each contains its two employees.  
  
```  
[  
  {  
    "department_name": "cloud",  
    "employees": [  
      {  
        "department_id": 2,  
        "name": "Craig",  
        "start_date": "2019-11-01"  
      },  
      {  
        "department_id": 2,  
        "name": "Dan",  
        "start_date": "2020-10-01"  
      }  
    ]  
  },  
  {  
    "department_name": "spatial",  
    "employees": [  
      {  
        "department_id": 1,  
        "name": "Paul",  
        "start_date": "2018-09-02"  
      },  
      {  
        "department_id": 1,  
        "name": "Martin",  
        "start_date": "2019-09-02"  
      }  
    ]  
  }  
]  
```  
  
If you would prefer your output to be an associative array instead of a list, replace the final json_agg with json_object_agg.  
  
## All your tables in JSON  
Ever wanted to quickly extract a definition of your table structures from the database? With the JSON formatters and the PostgreSQL system tables, all that info is right at hand.  
  
```  
WITH rows AS (  
  SELECT c.relname, a.attname, a.attnotnull, a.attnum, t.typname  
  FROM pg_class c  
  JOIN pg_attribute a   
    ON c.oid = a.attrelid and a.attnum >= 0  
  JOIN pg_type t  
    ON t.oid = a.atttypid  
  JOIN pg_namespace n  
    ON c.relnamespace = n.oid  
  WHERE n.nspname = 'public'  
    AND c.relkind = 'r'  
),                                    
agg AS (       
  SELECT rows.relname, json_agg(rows ORDER BY attnum) AS attrs  
  FROM rows  
  GROUP BY rows.relname  
)                             
SELECT json_object_agg(agg.relname, agg.attrs)  
FROM agg;  
```  
  
Here's the entry for the "departments" table.  
  
```  
{  
  "departments": [  
    {  
      "relname": "departments",  
      "attname": "department_id",  
      "attnotnull": true,  
      "attnum": 1,  
      "typname": "int8"  
    },  
    {  
      "relname": "departments",  
      "attname": "name",  
      "attnotnull": false,  
      "attnum": 2,  
      "typname": "text"  
    }  
  ],  
  ...  
}  
```  
  
## Conclusion  
- PostgreSQL JSON emitters can turn any result set into JSON right in the database  
- Web tiers can be vastly simplified by pushing JSON creation further down the stack  
- Custom types can emit custom JSON if a cast to json is defined on them
