## pg_dirtyread  
Earlier this week, I updated pg_dirtyread to work with PostgreSQL 14. pg_dirtyread is a PostgreSQL extension that allows reading "dead" rows from tables, i.e. rows that have already been deleted, or updated. Of course that works only if the table has not been cleaned-up yet by a VACUUM command or autovacuum, which is PostgreSQL's garbage collection machinery.  
  
Here's an example of pg_dirtyread in action:  
  
```  
# create table foo (id int, t text);  
CREATE TABLE  
# insert into foo values (1, 'Doc1');  
INSERT 0 1  
# insert into foo values (2, 'Doc2');  
INSERT 0 1  
# insert into foo values (3, 'Doc3');  
INSERT 0 1  
  
# select * from foo;  
 id │  t  
────┼──────  
  1 │ Doc1  
  2 │ Doc2  
  3 │ Doc3  
(3 rows)  
  
# delete from foo where id < 3;  
DELETE 2  
  
# select * from foo;  
 id │  t  
────┼──────  
  3 │ Doc3  
(1 row)  
```  
  
Oops! The first two documents have disappeared.  
  
Now let's use pg_dirtyread to look at the table:  
  
```  
# create extension pg_dirtyread;  
CREATE EXTENSION  
  
# select * from pg_dirtyread('foo') t(id int, t text);  
 id │  t  
────┼──────  
  1 │ Doc1  
  2 │ Doc2  
  3 │ Doc3  
```  
  
All three documents are still there, but only one of them is visible.  
  
pg_dirtyread can also show PostgreSQL's system colums with the row location and visibility information. For the first two documents, xmax is set, which means the row has been deleted:  
  
```  
# select * from pg_dirtyread('foo') t(ctid tid, xmin xid, xmax xid, id int, t text);  
 ctid  │ xmin │ xmax │ id │  t  
───────┼──────┼──────┼────┼──────  
 (0,1) │ 1577 │ 1580 │  1 │ Doc1  
 (0,2) │ 1578 │ 1580 │  2 │ Doc2  
 (0,3) │ 1579 │    0 │  3 │ Doc3  
(3 rows)  
```  
  
I always had plans to extend pg_dirtyread to include some "undelete" command to make deleted rows reappear, but never got around to trying that. But rows can already be restored by using the output of pg_dirtyread itself:  
  
```  
# insert into foo select * from pg_dirtyread('foo') t(id int, t text) where id = 1;  
```  
  
This is not a true "undelete", though - it just inserts new rows from the data read from the table.  
  
## pg_surgery  
Enter pg_surgery, which is a new PostgreSQL extension supplied with PostgreSQL 14. It contains two functions to "perform surgery on a damaged relation". As a side-effect, they can also make delete tuples reappear.  
  
As I discovered now, one of the functions, heap_force_freeze(), works nicely with pg_dirtyread. It takes a list of ctids (row locations) that it marks "frozen", but at the same time as "not deleted".  
  
Let's apply it to our test table, using the ctids that pg_dirtyread can read:  
  
```  
# create extension pg_surgery;  
CREATE EXTENSION  
  
# select heap_force_freeze('foo', array_agg(ctid))  
    from pg_dirtyread('foo') t(ctid tid, xmin xid, xmax xid, id int, t text) where id = 1;  
 heap_force_freeze  
───────────────────  
  
(1 row)  
```  
  
Et voilà, our deleted document is back:  
  
```  
# select * from foo;  
 id │  t  
────┼──────  
  1 │ Doc1  
  3 │ Doc3  
(2 rows)  
  
# select * from pg_dirtyread('foo') t(ctid tid, xmin xid, xmax xid, id int, t text);  
 ctid  │ xmin │ xmax │ id │  t  
───────┼──────┼──────┼────┼──────  
 (0,1) │    2 │    0 │  1 │ Doc1  
 (0,2) │ 1578 │ 1580 │  2 │ Doc2  
 (0,3) │ 1579 │    0 │  3 │ Doc3  
(3 rows)  
```  
  
## Disclaimer  
Most importantly, none of the above methods will work if the data you just deleted has already been purged by VACUUM or autovacuum. These actively zero out reclaimed space. Restore from backup to get your data back.  
  
Since both pg_dirtyread and pg_surgery operate outside the normal PostgreSQL MVCC machinery, it's easy to create corrupt data using them. This includes duplicated rows, duplicated primary key values, indexes being out of sync with tables, broken foreign key constraints, and others. You have been warned.  
  
pg_dirtyread does not work (yet) if the deleted rows contain any toasted values. Possible other approaches include using pageinspect and pg_filedump to retrieve the ctids of deleted rows.  
  
Please make sure you have working backups and don't need any of the above.
