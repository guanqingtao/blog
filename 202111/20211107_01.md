Add support for LZ4 compression in pg_receivewal  
  
pg_receivewal gains a new option, --compression-method=lz4, available  
when the code is compiled with --with-lz4.  Similarly to gzip, this  
gives the possibility to compress archived WAL segments with LZ4.  This  
option is not compatible with --compress.  
  
The implementation uses LZ4 frames, and is compatible with simple lz4  
commands.  Like gzip, using --synchronous ensures that any data will be  
flushed to disk within the current .partial segment, so as it is  
possible to retrieve as much WAL data as possible even from a  
non-completed segment (this requires completing the partial file with  
zeros up to the WAL segment size supported by the backend after  
decompression, but this is the same as gzip).  
  
The calculation of the streaming start LSN is able to transparently find  
and check LZ4-compressed segments.  Contrary to gzip where the  
uncompressed size is directly stored in the object read, the LZ4 chunk  
protocol does not store the uncompressed data by default.  There is  
contentSize that can be used with LZ4 frames by that would not help if  
using an archive that includes segments compressed with the defaults of  
a "lz4" command, where this is not stored.  So, this commit has taken  
the most extensible approach by decompressing the already-archived  
segment to check its uncompressed size, through a blank output buffer in  
chunks of 64kB (no actual performance difference noticed with 8kB, 16kB  
or 32kB, and the operation in itself is actually fast).  
  
Tests have been added to verify the creation and correctness of the  
generated LZ4 files.  The latter is achieved by the use of command  
"lz4", if found in the environment.  
  
The tar-based WAL method in walmethods.c, used now only by  
pg_basebackup, does not know yet about LZ4.  Its code could be extended  
for this purpose.
