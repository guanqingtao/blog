## 背景       
pg_basebackup 作为PG的基本备份工具, 目前已经稳定运行N年, 但是随着未来功能需求越来越多, 先前代码全部堆在basebackup.c的方式可能会使得pg_basebackup的功能堆叠变得更难, 所以PG 15会把pg_basebackup的各个功能模块化, 抽象到不同的模块, 为将来更好的扩展pg_basebackup的功能做好准备.

Introduce 'bbsink' abstraction to modularize base backup code.  
  
The base backup code has accumulated a healthy number of new  
features over the years, but it's becoming increasingly difficult  
to maintain and further enhance that code because there's no  
real separation of concerns. For example, the code that  
understands knows the details of how we send data to the client  
using the libpq protocol is scattered throughout basebackup.c,  
rather than being centralized in one place.  
  
To try to improve this situation, introduce a new 'bbsink' object  
which acts as a recipient for archives generated during the base  
backup progress and also for the backup manifest. This commit  
introduces three types of bbsink: a 'copytblspc' bbsink forwards the  
backup to the client using one COPY OUT operation per tablespace and  
another for the manifest, a 'progress' bbsink performs command  
progress reporting, and a 'throttle' bbsink performs rate-limiting.  
The 'progress' and 'throttle' bbsink types also forward the data to a  
successor bbsink; at present, the last bbsink in the chain will  
always be of type 'copytblspc'. There are plans to add more types  
of 'bbsink' in future commits.  
  
This abstraction is a bit leaky in the case of progress reporting,  
but this still seems cleaner than what we had before.

Introduce 'bbstreamer' abstraction to modularize pg_basebackup.  
  
pg_basebackup knows how to do quite a few things with a backup that it  
gets from the server, like just write out the files, or compress them  
first, or even parse the tar format and inject a modified  
postgresql.auto.conf file into the archive generated by the server.  
Unforatunely, this makes pg_basebackup.c a very large source file, and  
also somewhat difficult to enhance, because for example the knowledge  
that the server is sending us a 'tar' file rather than some other sort  
of archive is spread all over the place rather than centralized.  
  
In an effort to improve this situation, this commit invents a new  
'bbstreamer' abstraction. Each archive received from the server is  
fed to a bbstreamer which may choose to dispose of it or pass it  
along to some other bbstreamer. Chunks may also be "labelled"  
according to whether they are part of the payload data of a file  
in the archive or part of the archive metadata.  
  
So, for example, if we want to take a tar file, modify the  
postgresql.auto.conf file it contains, and the gzip the result  
and write it out, we can use a bbstreamer_tar_parser to parse the  
tar file received from the server, a bbstreamer_recovery_injector  
to modify the contents of postgresql.auto.conf, a  
bbstreamer_tar_archiver to replace the tar headers for the file  
modified in the previous step with newly-built ones that are  
correct for the modified file, and a bbstreamer_gzip_writer to  
gzip and write the resulting data. Only the objects with "tar"  
in the name know anything about the tar archive format, and in  
theory we could re-archive using some other format rather than  
"tar" if somebody wanted to write the code.  
  
These chances do add a substantial amount of code, but I think the  
result is a lot more maintainable and extensible. pg_basebackup.c  
itself shrinks by roughly a third, with a lot of the complexity  
previously contained there moving into the newly-added files.  
  
Patch by me. The larger patch series of which this is a part has been  
reviewed and tested at various times by Andres Freund, Sumanta  
Mukherjee, Dilip Kumar, Suraj Kharage, Dipesh Pandit, Tushar Ahuja,
