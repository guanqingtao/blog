## 背景   
pg_hba.conf 支持通配符, 适合SaaS类场景、DBaaS类场景 高效率配置数据库访问控制规则.

Add support for regexps on database and user entries in pg_hba.conf  
  
As of this commit, any database or user entry beginning with a slash (/)  
is considered as a regular expression.  This is particularly useful for  
users, as now there is no clean way to match pattern on multiple HBA  
lines.  For example, a user name mapping with a regular expression needs  
first to match with a HBA line, and we would skip the follow-up HBA  
entries if the ident regexp does *not* match with what has matched in  
the HBA line.  
  
pg_hba.conf is able to handle multiple databases and roles with a  
comma-separated list of these, hence individual regular expressions that  
include commas need to be double-quoted.  
  
At authentication time, user and database names are now checked in the  
following order:  
- Arbitrary keywords (like "all", the ones beginning by '+' for  
membership check), that we know will never have a regexp.  A fancy case  
is for physical WAL senders, we *have* to only match "replication" for  
the database.  
- Regular expression matching.  
- Exact match.  
The previous logic did the same, but without the regexp step.  
  
We have discussed as well the possibility to support regexp pattern  
matching for host names, but these happen to lead to tricky issues based  
on what I understand, particularly with host entries that have CIDRs.  
  
This commit relies heavily on the refactoring done in a903971 and  
fc579e1, so as the amount of code required to compile and execute  
regular expressions is now minimal.  When parsing pg_hba.conf, all the  
computed regexps needs to explicitely free()'d, same as pg_ident.conf.  
  
Documentation and TAP tests are added to cover this feature, including  
cases where the regexps use commas (for clarity in the docs, coverage  
for the parsing logic in the tests).  
  
Note that this introduces a breakage with older versions, where a  
database or user name beginning with a slash are treated as something to  
check for an equal match.  Per discussion, we have discarded this as  
being much of an issue in practice as it would require a cluster to  
have database and/or role names that begin with a slash, as well as HBA  
entries using these.  Hence, the consistency gained with regexps in  
pg_ident.conf is more appealing in the long term.  
  
**This compatibility change should be mentioned in the release notes.**
