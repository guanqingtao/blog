PostgreSQL , pgsentinel , 历史活跃会话快照

## 背景           
用来记录历史活跃会话, stat_statements快照等. 回看历史问题

he worker is controlled by the following GUCs:  
  
Parameter name	Data type	Description	Default value	Min value  
pgsentinel_ash.sampling_period	int4	Period for history sampling in seconds	1	1  
pgsentinel_ash.max_entries	int4	Size of pg_active_session_history in-memory ring buffer	1000	1000  
pgsentinel.db_name	char	database the worker should connect to	postgres	  
pgsentinel_pgssh.max_entries	int4	Size of pg_stat_statements_history in-memory ring buffer	1000	1000  
pgsentinel_pgssh.enable	boolean	enable pg_stat_statements_history	false	  
  
PostgreSQL provides session activity. However, in order to gather activity  
behavior user have to sample the pg_stat_activity view multiple times. pgsentinel is an extension to record active session history and also link the activity with query statistics (pg_stat_statements).  
  
The module must be loaded by adding pgsentinel to shared_preload_libraries in postgresql.conf, means that a server restart is needed to add or remove the module.  
  
When pgsentinel is enabled, it collects the history of session activity:  
  
It's implemented as in-memory ring buffer where samples are written with given (configurable) period. Therefore, user can see some number of recent samples depending on history size (configurable).  
In combination with pg_stat_statements this extension can also link the session activity with query statistics.  
  
To get more granular queries statistic pgsentinel extension samples the pg_stat_statements view:  
  
at the same time it is sampling the active sessions  
only for the queryid that were associated to an active session (if any) during the sampling  
pgsentinel launches special background worker for gathering the sessions activity.  
  
历史pg_stat_activity活跃会话记录, 增加了几个列的信息  
  
You could see it as samplings of pg_stat_activity providing more information:  
  
ash_time: the sampling time  
top_level_query: the top level statement (in case PL/pgSQL is used)  
query: the statement being executed (not normalised, as it is in pg_stat_statements, means you see the values)  
cmdtype: the statement type (SELECT,UPDATE,INSERT,DELETE,UTILITY,UNKNOWN,NOTHING)  
queryid: the queryid of the statement which links to pg_stat_statements  
blockers: the number of blockers  
blockerpid: the pid of the blocker (if blockers = 1), the pid of one blocker (if blockers > 1)  
blocker_state: state of the blocker (state of the blockerpid)
