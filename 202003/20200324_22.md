## 背景       
https://github.com/iCyberon/pg_hashids  
  
pg_hashids, generate short unique ids from integers  
  
Hashids is a small open-source library that generates short, unique, non-sequential ids from numbers. It converts numbers like 347 into strings like “yr8”. You can also decode those ids back. This is useful in bundling several parameters into one or simply using them as short UIDs.  
  
You can use hashids to hide primary keys in your database. I've used the extension on several production databases.  
  
Tested PostgreSQL versions : 9.5.X and 9.6.X (Should work on older versions, just not tested)  
  
It's using hashids.c under the hood. More information about hashids and it's implementations here: hashids.org

Usage  
  
Encoding  
  
Returns a hash using the default alphabet and empty salt.  
  
```  
SELECT id_encode(1001); -- Result: jNl  
```  
  
Returns a hash using the default alphabet and supplied salt.  
  
```  
SELECT id_encode(1234567, 'This is my salt'); -- Result: Pdzxp  
```  
  
Returns a hash using the default alphabet, salt and minimum hash length.  
  
```  
SELECT id_encode(1234567, 'This is my salt', 10); -- Result: PlRPdzxpR7  
```  
  
Returns a hash using the supplied alphabet, salt and minimum hash length.  
  
```  
SELECT id_encode(1234567, 'This is my salt', 10, 'abcdefghijABCDxFGHIJ1234567890'); -- Result: 3GJ956J9B9  
```  
  
Decoding  
  
You can also decode previouslt generated hashes. Just use the same salt, otherwise you'll get wrong results.  
  
```  
SELECT id_decode('PlRPdzxpR7', 'This is my salt', 10); -- Result: 1234567  
```  
  
Using a custom alphabet  
  
```  
SELECT id_decode('3GJ956J9B9', 'This is my salt', 10, 'abcdefghijABCDxFGHIJ1234567890'); -- Result: 1234567  
```
