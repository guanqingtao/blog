## 背景               
https://github.com/trustly/pg_badplan  
  
A PostgreSQL extension for logging queries where the expected/actual rows ratio exceeds a defined value  
  
What is it?  
pg_badplan is an PostgreSQL extension that logs when the planners row estimate vs actual is over a specified ratio.  
  
This is useful when you want to find queries where the planner might be doing a bad plan becase the statistics is bad.  
  
It works by installing execution start and end hooks that first enable row instrumentation and during end check the plans estimated vs executed actual rows. Since it enables instrumentation it will likely impose a performance penelty but how much we haven't measured.
