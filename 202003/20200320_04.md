GIS 完整开源解决方案 - Crunchy Spatial - API, Web, GIS, database, 动态矢量瓦片  
  
全套解决, 如果你需要部署GIS类应用, 这是一个不二之选.    
  
Crunchy Spatial extends Crunchy Certified PostgreSQL with a collection of standard open source tools for enterprises that need standard spatial analysis, mapping, and location-based functionality in their applications. This includes:  
  
- Web vector maps delivered through simple REST API  
- Interface with spatial features in your database  
- Dynamic vector tiles and features direct from the database with no caching or long refresh times  
- Micro-service architecture, for easy deployment in the cloud  
- No-code middleware to link web apps to spatial SQL smarts  
- Low overhead to maximize data serving performance  
  
Crunchy Spatial implements the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards for Simple Feature Access Through SQL and OGC API - Features.  
  
同时crunchy也支持了一些通用的矢量瓦片管理套件  
  
pg_tileserv is one component in “PostGIS for the Web” (aka “PostGIS FTW”), a growing family of Go spatial microservices. Database-centric applications naturally have a central source of coordinating state, the database, which allows otherwise independent microservices to coordinate and provide HTTP-level access to the database with less middleware software complexity.  
  
- pg_tileserv provides MVT tiles for interactive clients and smooth rendering  
- pg_featureserv provides GeoJSON feature services for reading and writing vector and attribute data from tables  
  
PostGIS for the Web makes it possible to stand up a spatial services architecture of stateless microservices surrounding a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database cluster, in a standard container environment, on any cloud platform or internal datacenter.
