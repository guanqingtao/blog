## 背景   
  
1、什么时候适合sp-gist?  
- 数据要求: 无空间交叠, 或只有少量交叠. (即 geo overlap, range overlap);  
- 查询要求: 精确定位, 或只返回少量数据(例如小范围的包含查询);  
  
原因:  
- 一个sp-gist index page内可能存储多个node的数据, sp-gist采用逐级空间分区切分整理数据, 大范围查询可能需要访问很多node, 而这些NODE可能存放在不同的index page(block)中, 造成索引访问IO放大.   
- 实际上gist 也存在空间放大问题, 但是node不跨page, 影像可能少一点. 解决方法如下:
    - [《PostgreSQL multipolygon 空间索引查询过滤精简优化 - IO，CPU放大优化》](../201711/20171122_03.md)  
    - [《PostgreSQL 推荐系统优化总计 - 空间、时间、标量等混合多模查询场景, 大量已读过滤导致CPU IO剧增(类挖矿概率下降优化)》](../202006/20200612_01.md)  
    - [《PostgreSQL 空间st_contains，st_within空间包含搜索优化 - 降IO和降CPU(bound box) (多边形GiST优化)》](../201710/20171004_01.md)  
    - [《PostgreSQL 空间切割(st_split, ST_Subdivide)功能扩展 - 空间对象网格化 (多边形GiST优化)》](../201710/20171005_01.md)  
  
以上放大使用`explain (analyze,verbose,timing,costs,buffers)`可以观察.  
  
2、其他适合gist

- Yes, you need a spatial index for your spatial data!  
- Don't neglect the possibility of using the newer SPGIST implementation over the tried-and-true GIST, particularly if your data is relatively uniform and does not have a lot of overlap.  
- Consider BRIN only if your data table is large, and stored in highly spatially correlated order.  
  
https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/374091/when-to-use-gist-and-when-to-use-sp-gist-index  
  
An exact answer is not possible without testing on your actual data, as this is highly dependent on the data size, structure, corresponding PostgreSQL internals, and the exact queries you intent to use the index for.  
  
Generally speaking, it is perfectly fine to assume a GIST index is what you want.  
  
Some basic considerations:  
- `GIST` has full operator support, including `(k)NN` searches  
- `SP-GIST` doesn't support `(k)NN` as of yet (高版本PG spgist已支持某些类型KNN), and supports fewer operators (which is probably not a real issue, though)  
  
- `GIST` isn't overly sensitive to the spatial distribution (homogeneous/consistently spaced vs heterogeneous/blobs of geometries) and the topology (many overlaps vs isolated distribution) of your geometries  
- `SP_GIST` is most effective for non-overlapping geometries, and boost searches for spatially homogeneous distributions, due to its Spatial Partitioning  
  
- `GIST` creation time is rising slightly non-linear with the amount of data it has to ingest, but has a an overall stable increase (ballpark figure: 20 minutes for 100 million rows (points; global distribution))  
- `SP_GIST` is likely faster for smaller amount of data, but tends to have a significant performance drop after a few hundred million geometries compared to `GIST`  
  
- `GIST` indexes have a non-trivial storage impact (ballpark figure: 5GB for 100 million geometries), but only `BRIN` indexes really make a difference here  
- `SP-GIST` has a few percentages less space requirement  
  
However:  
- Since it seems you are having homogeneously distributed `POINTs`, you could definitely try the `SP_GIST` index and see if you get more performance out of it; this is still dependent on other factors that are linked to PG internals, relation and result statistics, though.  
    - But it will likely be slower if all you filter for is all points within a large bbox, as this is better covered with `GIST`.  
- spgist is most effective when data is homogenous & non-overlapping: "Don't neglect the possibility of using the newer `SPGIST` implementation over the tried-and-true `GIST`, particularly if your data is relatively uniform and does not have a lot of overlap.
