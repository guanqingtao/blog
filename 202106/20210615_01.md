## 背景  
  
pgSCV — metrics exporter for PostgreSQL (not only)

# pgSCV - PostgreSQL ecosystem metrics collector.  
  
### pgSCV  
- [collects](https://github.com/weaponry/pgscv/wiki/Collectors) a lot of stats about system, PostgreSQL, Pgbouncers, etc.  
- exposes metrics through the HTTP `/metrics` endpoint in [Prometheus metrics exposition format](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/).  
  
### Features  
- **Pull mode**. pgSCV can listen on `/metrics` endpoint and serving requests from `Prometheus` or `Victoriametrics' Vmagent`.  
- **Push mode**. pgSCV can scrape its own `/metrics` endpoint and push scraped metrics to specified HTTP service.  
  This feature primarily used for sending metrics to Weaponry SaaS, but not limited by this purpose.  
- **Collecting metrics from multiple services**. pgSCV can collect metrics from many databases instances.  
- **Services auto-discovery**. pgSCV can automatically discover Postgres and other Postgres-ecosystem services and  
  start collecting metrics from them. In case of authentication, valid requisites should be specified.  
- **Remote services support**. pgSCV is recommended to start on the same systems where monitored services are running.  
  But this is not strict and pgSCV could connect and collect metrics from remote services.  
- **Bootstrap**. pgSCV can bootstrap itself - it is one-time procedure, during bootstrap pgSCV installs itself into system path, creates minimal required configuration,  
  installs systemd unit and starts itself. **Requires root privileges.**  
- **Auto-update**. pgSCV can track new releases and update itself. This feature is mostly useful for Weaponry users. **Requires root privileges.**  
- **User-defined metrics**. pgSCV could be configured in a way to collect metrics defined by user.  
- **Collectors management**. Collectors could be disabled if necessary.  
- **Collectors filters**. Collectors could be adjusted to skip collecting metrics based on labels values, like  
  block devices, network interfaces, filesystems, users, databases, etc.  
  
### Requirements  
- can run on Linux only; can connect to remote services running on other OS/PaaS.  
- requisites for connecting to the services, such as login and password.  
- database user should have privileges for executing stats functions and reading views.  
  For more details see [security considerations](https://github.com/weaponry/pgscv/wiki/Security-considerations).  
  
### Quick start  
Download the archive from [releases](https://github.com/weaponry/pgscv/releases). Unpack the archive. Start pgSCV under `postgres` user.  
  
```shell  
wget https://github.com/weaponry/pgscv/releases/download/v0.6.0/pgscv_0.6.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz  
tar xvzf pgscv_0.6.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz  
sudo -u postgres ./pgscv   
```  
  
or using Docker, use `DATABASE_DSN` for setting up a connection to Postgres:  
```  
docker pull weaponry/pgscv:latest  
docker run -ti -e PGSCV_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:9890 -e PGSCV_DISABLE_COLLECTORS="system" -e DATABASE_DSN="postgresql://postgres@dbhost/postgres" -p 9890:9890 weaponry/pgscv:latest  
```  
  
When pgSCV has been started it is ready to accept HTTP requests at `http://127.0.0.1:9890/metrics`.  
  
### Complete setup  
pgSCV complete setup is possible in two ways:  
1. For **non-Weaponry** users. Setup as a standalone service, which accepts metrics scrape requests only. Checkout complete setup [guide](https://github.com/weaponry/pgscv/wiki/Setup-for-regular-users).  
2. For **Weaponry** users. Setup as an agent of Weaponry SaaS, which receives metrics to Weaponry service. Checkout complete setup [guide](https://github.com/weaponry/pgscv/wiki/Setup-for-Weaponry-users). Listening for scrape requests also work.  
  
### Documentation  
For further documentation see [wiki](https://github.com/weaponry/pgscv/wiki).  
  
### Support and feedback  
If you need help using pgSCV feel free to open discussion or create an [issue](https://github.com/weaponry/pgscv/issues)  
  
### Development and contribution  
To help development you are encouraged to:  
- provide [suggestion/feedback](https://github.com/weaponry/pgscv/discussions) or [issue](https://github.com/weaponry/pgscv/issues)

## Charts  
Charts are basic unit of observability visualization. Weaponry provides a rich set of charts useful for watching on performance metrics and how systems work during time.  
  
1、Database activity  
Activity charts help to answer on questions how many queries and transactions are processed, how fast they are processed and is there any potentially dangerous activity among connected clients.  
  
2、Running queries  
Queries define a workload. Discover how workload is changed, looking for slowest or resource-hog queries and optimize them to improve performance.  
  
3、Wait events and Locks  
Blocked queries make your applications slower. Check for locks and hot wait events, they tell you about workload bottlenecks.  
  
4、Running workload  
Tables and indexes are used by queries and are workloads objects. Check usage of tables and indexes and how workload is changed across the time.  
  
5、Background services  
Overall performance depends on how well background services do their work. It is important to avoid bottlenecks related to poor configurations. But remember, background services consume resources too - user queries must not suffer.  
  
6、3rd party utilities  
Together with Postgres there are could be other services which matter in database infrastructure. Connection pools, cluster management tools, queues - observe them to have more knowledge about database environment.  
  
7、System load  
Databases utilize system resources like CPU, Memory, IO, etc. Track capacity metrics to understand there is a sufficient amount of resources allocated for databases.  
  
8、Storage utilization  
Traditionally, storage layer is slower than CPU and memory, it might be critical in case of workload spikes. Storage performance metrics show you how databases sustainable to IO-intensive workloads.  
  
9、More charts...  
We are always on a way to looking for new charts that help in database administration.  
  
## Logs  
Logs are important source of information, which is often underestimated or even forgotten. Collecting log-based metrics we extend observability and allow you avoid manual logs processing.  
  
1、Log summary  
Summary is the first look on logs, before further investigating and troubleshooting.  
  
## Reports  
Reports provide summary information and cover long periods of time. We are extending list of reports, to provide you complete understanding about database environment.  
  
1、Executed statements  
Detect the most slower or resource-hog statements and its runtime characteristics. Optimize such queries and allow the database effectively utilize resources.  
  
## Recommendations  
Database and environment have many configuration aspects that depend on workload - we trying to analyze necessary metrics, find misconfigurations and bottlenecks. We propose configuration changes that allow the database work efficiently.  
  
1、Configuration  
Inspecting configuration settings and workload metrics we looking for optimal configuration.  
  
2、Database schema  
Inspecting database schema we looking for hidden design drawbacks and potentially dangerous things which could lead to failures and accidents.
