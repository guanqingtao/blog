## 背景           
[《PostgreSQL 14 preview - recovery 加速, 支持prefetch 预读接下来要恢复的wal record相关的data block到shared buffer, 加速wal record+data block的合并过程》](../202104/20210409_03.md)    
  
14被打回的特性, 15又放进来了. 目的是提高recovery速度(包括崩溃恢复、逻辑流复制、物理流复制、归档恢复), 异步预读datafile blocks(从wal解析到的需要恢复的数据文件对应blocks)到buffer pool.   
  
相关参数 recovery_prefetch、wal_decode_buffer_size、maintenance_io_concurrency.   
  
相关系统视图 pg_stat_recovery_prefetch.

Prefetch data referenced by the WAL, take II.  
  
Introduce a new GUC recovery_prefetch.  When enabled, look ahead in the  
WAL and try to initiate asynchronous reading of referenced data blocks  
that are not yet cached in our buffer pool.  For now, this is done with  
posix_fadvise(), which has several caveats.  Since not all OSes have  
that system call, "try" is provided so that it can be enabled where  
available.  Better mechanisms for asynchronous I/O are possible in later  
work.  
  
Set to "try" for now for test coverage.  Default setting to be finalized  
before release.  
  
The GUC wal_decode_buffer_size limits the distance we can look ahead in  
bytes of decoded data.  
  
The existing GUC maintenance_io_concurrency is used to limit the number  
of concurrent I/Os allowed, based on pessimistic heuristics used to  
infer that I/Os have begun and completed.  We'll also not look more than  
maintenance_io_concurrency * 4 block references ahead.

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-RECOVERY-PREFETCH  
  
This section describes the settings that apply to recovery in general, affecting crash recovery, streaming replication and archive-based replication.  
  
recovery_prefetch (enum)  
Whether to try to prefetch blocks that are referenced in the WAL that are not yet in the buffer pool, during recovery. Valid values are off (the default), on and try. The setting try enables prefetching only if the operating system provides the posix_fadvise function, which is currently used to implement prefetching. Note that some operating systems provide the function, but it doesn't do anything.  
  
Prefetching blocks that will soon be needed can reduce I/O wait times during recovery with some workloads. See also the wal_decode_buffer_size and maintenance_io_concurrency settings, which limit prefetching activity.  
  
wal_decode_buffer_size (integer)  
A limit on how far ahead the server can look in the WAL, to find blocks to prefetch. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as bytes. The default is 512kB.  
  
maintenance_io_concurrency (integer)  
Similar to effective_io_concurrency, but used for maintenance work that is done on behalf of many client sessions.  
  
The default is 10 on supported systems, otherwise 0. This value can be overridden for tables in a particular tablespace by setting the tablespace parameter of the same name (see ALTER TABLESPACE).  
  
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/monitoring-stats.html#PG-STAT-RECOVERY-PREFETCH-VIEW  
  
  
pg_stat_recovery_prefetch  
  
The pg_stat_recovery_prefetch view will contain only one row. It is filled with nulls if recovery has not run or recovery_prefetch is not enabled. The columns wal_distance, block_distance and io_depth show current values, and the other columns show cumulative counters that can be reset with the pg_stat_reset_shared function.  
  
Table 28.17. pg_stat_recovery_prefetch View  
  
Column	|Type	|Description  
---|---|---  
prefetch	|bigint	|Number of blocks prefetched because they were not in the buffer pool  
hit	|bigint	|Number of blocks not prefetched because they were already in the buffer pool  
skip_init	|bigint	|Number of blocks not prefetched because they would be zero-initialized  
skip_new	|bigint	|Number of blocks not prefetched because they didn't exist yet  
skip_fpw	|bigint	|Number of blocks not prefetched because a full page image was included in the WAL  
skip_rep	|bigint	|Number of blocks not prefetched because they were already recently prefetched  
wal_distance	|integer	|How many bytes ahead the prefetcher is looking  
block_distance	|integer	|How many blocks ahead the prefetcher is looking  
io_depth	|integer	|How many prefetches have been initiated but are not yet known to have completed
