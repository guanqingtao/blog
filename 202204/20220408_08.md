## 背景       
Generational allocator definitions是对具有相似生命周期的memory context chunks的内存分配和管理的相关代码.    
    
PostgreSQL 15的增强在于支持     
- 指定最小、上限、初始内存大小.     
- keeper块(即不能回收的内存块), 但是free后可以重复使用.

Improve the generation memory allocator    
    
Here we make a series of improvements to the generation memory    
allocator, namely:    
    
1. Allow generation contexts to have a minimum, initial and maximum block    
sizes. The standard allocator allows this already but when the generation    
context was added, it only allowed fixed-sized blocks.  The problem with    
fixed-sized blocks is that it's difficult to choose how large to make the    
blocks.  If the chosen size is too small then we'd end up with a large    
number of blocks and a large number of malloc calls. If the block size is    
made too large, then memory is wasted.    
    
2. Add support for "keeper" blocks.  This is a special block that is    
allocated along with the context itself but is never freed.  Instead,    
when the last chunk in the keeper block is freed, we simply mark the block    
as empty to allow new allocations to make use of it.    
    
3. Add facility to "recycle" newly empty blocks instead of freeing them    
and having to later malloc an entire new block again.  We do this by    
recording a single GenerationBlock which has become empty of any chunks.    
When we run out of space in the current block, we check to see if there is    
a "freeblock" and use that if it contains enough space for the allocation.

  24  *  number of free chunks is equal to the number of allocated chunks.  When    
  25  *  this occurs, instead of freeing the block, we try to "recycle" it, i.e.    
  26  *  reuse it for new allocations.  This is done by setting the block in the

  28  *  by another free block we simply return the newly empty block to malloc.

Use Generation memory contexts to store tuples in sorts

The general usage pattern when we store tuples in tuplesort.c is that
we store a series of tuples one by one then either perform a sort or spill
them to disk.  In the common case, there is no pfreeing of already stored
tuples.  For the common case since we do not individually pfree tuples, we
have very little need for aset.c memory allocation behavior which
maintains freelists and always rounds allocation sizes up to the next
power of 2 size.

Here we conditionally use generation.c contexts for storing tuples in
tuplesort.c when the sort will never be bounded.  Unfortunately, the
memory context to store tuples is already created by the time any calls
would be made to tuplesort_set_bound(), so here we add a new sort option
that allows callers to specify if they're going to need a bounded sort or
not.  We'll use a standard aset.c allocator when this sort option is not
set.

Extension authors must ensure that the TUPLESORT_ALLOWBOUNDED flag is
used when calling tuplesort_begin_* for any sorts that make a call to
tuplesort_set_bound().
