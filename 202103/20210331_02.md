## 背景  
原来postgres_fdw在非parallel 执行计划中有append操作时, 多个server的node是串行执行, 性能较差.  
  
PostgreSQL 14 增强FDW接口, 增加异步执行接口, 同时在postgres_fdw中支持了append异步, 大幅提升性能. 需要设置foreign server async_capable=true.

Add support for asynchronous execution.  
  
This implements asynchronous execution, which runs multiple parts of a  
non-parallel-aware Append concurrently rather than serially to improve  
performance when possible.  Currently, the only node type that can be  
run concurrently is a ForeignScan that is an immediate child of such an  
Append.  In the case where such ForeignScans access data on different  
remote servers, this would run those ForeignScans concurrently, and  
overlap the remote operations to be performed simultaneously, so it'll  
improve the performance especially when the operations involve  
time-consuming ones such as remote join and remote aggregation.  
  
We may extend this to other node types such as joins or aggregates over  
ForeignScans in the future.  
  
This also adds the support for postgres_fdw, which is enabled by the  
table-level/server-level option "async_capable".  The default is false.

+Asynchronous Execution  
+----------------------  
+  
+In cases where a node is waiting on an event external to the database system,  
+such as a ForeignScan awaiting network I/O, it's desirable for the node to  
+indicate that it cannot return any tuple immediately but may be able to do so  
+at a later time.  A process which discovers this type of situation can always  
+handle it simply by blocking, but this may waste time that could be spent  
+executing some other part of the plan tree where progress could be made  
+immediately.  This is particularly likely to occur when the plan tree contains  
+an Append node.  Asynchronous execution runs multiple parts of an Append node  
+concurrently rather than serially to improve performance.  
+  
+For asynchronous execution, an Append node must first request a tuple from an  
+async-capable child node using ExecAsyncRequest.  Next, it must execute the  
+asynchronous event loop using ExecAppendAsyncEventWait.  Eventually, when a  
+child node to which an asynchronous request has been made produces a tuple,  
+the Append node will receive it from the event loop via ExecAsyncResponse.  In  
+the current implementation of asynchronous execution, the only node type that  
+requests tuples from an async-capable child node is an Append, while the only  
+node type that might be async-capable is a ForeignScan.  
+  
+Typically, the ExecAsyncResponse callback is the only one required for nodes  
+that wish to request tuples asynchronously.  On the other hand, async-capable  
+nodes generally need to implement three methods:  
+  
+1. When an asynchronous request is made, the node's ExecAsyncRequest callback  
+   will be invoked; it should use ExecAsyncRequestPending to indicate that the  
+   request is pending for a callback described below.  Alternatively, it can  
+   instead use ExecAsyncRequestDone if a result is available immediately.  
+  
+2. When the event loop wishes to wait or poll for file descriptor events, the  
+   node's ExecAsyncConfigureWait callback will be invoked to configure the  
+   file descriptor event for which the node wishes to wait.  
+  
+3. When the file descriptor becomes ready, the node's ExecAsyncNotify callback  
+   will be invoked; like #1, it should use ExecAsyncRequestPending for another  
+   callback or ExecAsyncRequestDone to return a result immediately.
