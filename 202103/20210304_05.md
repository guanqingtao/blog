## 背景       
[《PostgreSQL 14 preview - logical decoding 增加2pc 两阶段事务,xa事务 支持》](../202101/20210101_01.md)    
  
PG 14 新增一个pg_create_logical_replication_slot选项, 在创建slot时, 支持是否解析2pc.  
  
https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=19890a064ebf53dedcefed0d8339ed3d449b06e6  
  
```  
Add option to enable two_phase commits via pg_create_logical_replication_slot.  
  
Commit 0aa8a01d04 extends the output plugin API to allow decoding of  
prepared xacts and allowed the user to enable/disable the two-phase option  
via pg_logical_slot_get_changes(). This can lead to a problem such that  
the first time when it gets changes via pg_logical_slot_get_changes()  
without two_phase option enabled it will not get the prepared even though  
prepare is after consistent snapshot. Now next time during getting changes,  
if the two_phase option is enabled it can skip prepare because by that  
time start decoding point has been moved. So the user will only get commit  
prepared.  
  
Allow to enable/disable this option at the create slot time and default  
will be false. It will break the existing slots which is fine in a major  
release.

Amit, Ajin, hackers,



testing logical decoding for two-phase transactions, I stumbled over 
what I first thought is a bug.  But comments seems to indicate this is 
intended behavior.  Could you please clarify or elaborate on the design 
decision?  Or indicate this indeed is a bug?



What puzzled me is that if a decoder is restarted in between the PREPARE 
and the COMMIT PREPARED, it repeats the entire transaction, despite it 
being already sent and potentially prepared on the receiving side.



In terms of `pg_logical_slot_get_changes` (and roughly from the 
prepare.sql test), this looks as follows:



                         data
----------------------------------------------------
  BEGIN
  table public.test_prepared1: INSERT: id[integer]:1
  PREPARE TRANSACTION 'test_prepared#1'
(3 rows)



This is the first delivery of the transaction.  After a restart, it will 
get all of the changes again, though:



                         data
----------------------------------------------------
  BEGIN
  table public.test_prepared1: INSERT: id[integer]:1
  PREPARE TRANSACTION 'test_prepared#1'
  COMMIT PREPARED 'test_prepared#1'
(4 rows)



I did not expect this, as any receiver that wants to have decoded 2PC is 
likely supporting some kind of two-phase commits itself.  And would 
therefore prepare the transaction upon its first reception.  Potentially 
receiving it a second time would require complicated filtering on every 
prepared transaction.



Furthermore, this clearly and unnecessarily holds back the restart LSN. 
Meaning even just a single prepared transaction can block advancing the 
restart LSN.  In most cases, these are short lived.  But on the other 
hand, there may be an arbitrary amount of other transactions in between 
a PREPARE and the corresponding COMMIT PREPARED in the WAL.  Not being 
able to advance over a prepared transaction seems like a bad thing in 
such a case.



I fail to see where this repetition would ever be useful.  Is there any 
reason for the current implementation that I'm missing or can this be 
corrected?  Thanks for elaborating.



Regards



Markus
