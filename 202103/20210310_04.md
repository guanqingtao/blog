Track total amounts of times spent writing and syncing WAL data to disk.  
  
This commit adds new GUC track_wal_io_timing. When this is enabled,  
the total amounts of time XLogWrite writes and issue_xlog_fsync syncs  
WAL data to disk are counted in pg_stat_wal. This information would be  
useful to check how much WAL write and sync affect the performance.  
  
Enabling track_wal_io_timing will make the server query the operating  
system for the current time every time WAL is written or synced,  
which may cause significant overhead on some platforms. To avoid such  
additional overhead in the server with track_io_timing enabled,  
this commit introduces track_wal_io_timing as a separate parameter from  
track_io_timing.  
  
Note that WAL write and sync activity by walreceiver has not been tracked yet.  
  
This commit makes the server also track the numbers of times XLogWrite  
writes and issue_xlog_fsync syncs WAL data to disk, in pg_stat_wal,  
regardless of the setting of track_wal_io_timing. This counters can be  
used to calculate the WAL write and sync time per request, for example.  
  
Bump PGSTAT_FILE_FORMAT_ID.  
  
Bump catalog version.

28.2.12. pg_stat_wal  
The pg_stat_wal view will always have a single row, containing data about WAL activity of the cluster.  
  
Column Type  
Description  
  
wal_records bigint  
Total number of WAL records generated  
  
wal_fpi bigint  
Total number of WAL full page images generated  
  
wal_bytes numeric  
Total amount of WAL generated in bytes  
  
wal_buffers_full bigint  
Number of times WAL data was written to disk because WAL buffers became full  
  
wal_write bigint  
Number of times WAL buffers were written out to disk via XLogWrite request. See Section 30.5 for more information about the internal WAL function XLogWrite.  
  
wal_sync bigint  
Number of times WAL files were synced to disk via issue_xlog_fsync request (if fsync is on and wal_sync_method is either fdatasync, fsync or fsync_writethrough, otherwise zero). See Section 30.5 for more information about the internal WAL function issue_xlog_fsync.  
  
wal_write_time double precision  
Total amount of time spent writing WAL buffers to disk via XLogWrite request, in milliseconds (if track_wal_io_timing is enabled, otherwise zero). This includes the sync time when wal_sync_method is either open_datasync or open_sync.  
  
wal_sync_time double precision  
Total amount of time spent syncing WAL files to disk via issue_xlog_fsync request, in milliseconds (if track_wal_io_timing is enabled, fsync is on, and wal_sync_method is either fdatasync, fsync or fsync_writethrough, otherwise zero).  
  
stats_reset timestamp with time zone  
Time at which these statistics were last reset
