## 背景      
https://info.crunchydata.com/blog/polygon-averaging-in-postgis  
    
Let's say we received polygons from 10 users. If we used ST_Intersection on those polygons, the remaining polygon would only represent the points included in all 10 polygons. If we used ST_Union, the output would represent the points included in at least 1 polygon.  
  
Can anyone recommend a way to output a polygon that represents the points that are in n polygons, where n is greater than 1 and less than the total number of polygons (10 in this case)?  
  
这个问题是要知道在多个多边形叠加后, 在多边形内取一个点, 这个点到底被多少个多边形覆盖到了, 切出一个个的面, 每个面有多少个多边形叠加.

WITH   
edges AS   
  ( SELECT  
    (ST_Dump(  
     ST_UnaryUnion(  
     ST_Collect(  
     ST_ExteriorRing(p.geom))))).geom  
  FROM polygons p )  
```  
  
This requires a few functions:  
  
- [ST_ExteriorRing](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_ExteriorRing.html) to get the polygon boundary,  
- [ST_UnaryUnion](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_UnaryUnion.html) to mash all the rings together and break them at crossing points, and S  
- [ST_Dump](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Dump.html) to convert the output of the union (a multi-linestring) back into one row per geometry.
