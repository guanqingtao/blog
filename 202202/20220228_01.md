# OrioleDB – building a modern cloud-native storage engine  
(... and solving some PostgreSQL wicked problems)

OrioleDB is a new storage engine for PostgreSQL, bringing a modern approach to  
database capacity, capabilities and performance to the world's most-loved  
database platform.  
  
OrioleDB consists of an extension, building on the innovative table access  
method framework and other standard Postgres extension interfaces. By extending  
and enhancing the current table access methods, OrioleDB opens the door to  
a future of more powerful storage models that are optimized for cloud and  
modern hardware architectures.  
  
OrioleDB is currently distributed under the standard PostgreSQL license.  
  
1. Designed for modern hardware.  OrioleDB design avoids legacy CPU bottlenecks  
   on modern servers containing dozens and hundreds CPU cores, providing  
   optimized usage of modern storage technologies such as SSD and NVRAM.  
  
2. Reduced maintenance needs.  OrioleDB implements the concepts of undo log  
   and page-mergins, eliminating the need for dedicated garbage collection  
   processes.  Additionally, OrioleDB implements default 64-bit transaction  
   identifiers, thus eliminating the well-known and painful wraparound problem.  
  
3. Designed to be distributed.  OrioleDB implements a row-level write-ahead  
   log with support for parallel apply.  This log architecture is optimized  
   for raft consensus-based replication allowing the implementation of  
   active-active multimaster.  
  
The key technical differentiations of OrioleDB are as follows:  
  
1. No buffer mapping and lock-less page reading.  In-memory pages in OrioleDB  
   are connected with direct links to the storage pages.  This eliminates the  
   need for in-buffer mapping along with its related bottlenecks. Additionally,  
   in OrioleDB in-memory page reading doesn't involve atomic operations.  
   Together, these design decisions bring vertical scalability for Postgres  
   to the whole new level.  
  
2. MVCC is based on the UNDO log concept.  In OrioleDB, old versions of tuples  
   do not cause bloat in the main storage system, but eviction into the undo  
   log comprising undo chains.  Page-level undo records allow the system  
   to easily reclaim space occupied by deleted tuples as soon as possible.  
   Together with page-mergins, these mechanisms eliminate bloat in the majority  
   of cases.  Dedicated VACUUMing of tables is not needed as well, removing  
   a significant and common cause of system performance deterioration and  
   database outages.  
  
3. Copy-on-write checkpoints and row-level WAL.  OrioleDB utilizes  
   copy-on-write checkpoints, which provides a structurally consistent snapshot  
   of data every moment of time.  This is friendly for modern SSDs and allows  
   row-level WAL logging.  In turn, row-level WAL logging is easy to  
   parallelize (done), compact and suitable for active-active  
   multimaster (planned).  
  
See, [usage](doc/usage.md) and [architecture](doc/arch.md) documentation  
as well as [PostgresBuild 2021 slides](https://www.slideshare.net/AlexanderKorotkov/solving-postgresql-wicked-problems).  
  
## Status  
  
OrioleDB now has public alpha status.  It is recommended for experiments,  
testing, benchmarking, etc., but is not recommended for production usage.

## Installation  
  
Before building and installing OrioleDB, one should ensure to have the following:  
  
 * [PostgreSQL 14 with extensibility patches](https://github.com/orioledb/postgres),  
 * Development package of libzstd,  
 * python 3.5+ with testgres package.  
  
Typical installation procedure may look like this:  
  
```bash  
 $ git clone https://github.com/orioledb/orioledb  
 $ cd orioledb  
 $ make USE_PGXS=1  
 $ make USE_PGXS=1 install  
 $ make USE_PGXS=1 installcheck  
```  
  
Before starting working with OrioleDB, adding the following line to  
`postgresql.conf` is required.  This change requires a restart of  
the PostgreSQL database server.  
  
```  
shared_preload_libraries = 'orioledb.so'  
```  
  
And also run the following SQL-query on the database.  
  
```sql  
CREATE EXTENSION orioledb;  
```  
  
Once the above steps are complete, you can start using OrioleDB's tables.  
See [usage](doc/usage.md) documentation for details.  
  
```sql  
CREATE TABLE table_name (...) USING orioledb;  
```
