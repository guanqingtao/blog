## 背景  
PostgreSQL 15做纯wal的流式物理备份更加简单了, 因为pg_receivewal 支持了slot. 此前重启位点取决于pg_receivewal 自己在本地写wal文件时的文件名后缀partial, 而无法从上游slot中获取位点.

Add replication command READ_REPLICATION_SLOT  
  
The command is supported for physical slots for now, and returns the  
type of slot, its restart_lsn and its restart_tli.  
  
This will be useful for an upcoming patch related to pg_receivewal, to  
allow the tool to be able to stream from the position of a slot, rather  
than the last WAL position flushed by the backend (as reported by  
IDENTIFY_SYSTEM) if the archive directory is found as empty, which would  
be an advantage in the case of switching to a different archive  
locations with the same slot used to avoid holes in WAL segment  
archives.

Allow pg_receivewal to stream from a slot's restart LSN

Allow pg_receivewal to stream from a slot's restart LSN  
  
Prior to this patch, when running pg_receivewal, the streaming start  
point would be the current location of the archives if anything is  
found in the local directory where WAL segments are written, and  
pg_receivewal would fall back to the current WAL flush location if there  
are no archives, as of the result of an IDENTIFY_SYSTEM command.  
  
If for some reason the WAL files from pg_receivewal were moved, it is  
better to try a restart where we left at, which is the replication  
slot's restart_lsn instead of skipping right to the current flush  
location, to avoid holes in the WAL backed up.  This commit changes  
pg_receivewal to use the following sequence of methods to determine the  
starting streaming LSN:  
- Scan the local archives.  
- Use the slot's restart_lsn, if supported by the backend and if a slot  
is defined.  
- Fallback to the current flush LSN as reported by IDENTIFY_SYSTEM.  
  
To keep compatibility with older server versions, we only attempt to use  
READ_REPLICATION_SLOT if the backend version is at least 15, and  
fallback to the older behavior of streaming from the current flush  
LSN if the command is not supported.  
  
Some TAP tests are added to cover this feature.
