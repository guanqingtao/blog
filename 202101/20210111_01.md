## 背景  
PostgreSQL 14 将支持IO向量化功能, 提高读写性能.   
  
与此类似的还有CPU向量化加速:

Provide pg_preadv() and pg_pwritev().  
  
Provide synchronous vectored file I/O routines.  These map to preadv()  
and pwritev(), with fallback implementations for systems that don't have  
them.  Also provide a wrapper pg_pwritev_with_retry() that automatically  
retries on short writes.

Use vectored I/O to fill new WAL segments.  
  
Instead of making many block-sized write() calls to fill a new WAL file  
with zeroes, make a smaller number of pwritev() calls (or various  
emulations).  The actual number depends on the OS's IOV_MAX, which  
PG_IOV_MAX currently caps at 32.  That means we'll write 256kB per call  
on typical systems.  We may want to tune the number later with more  
experience.

```  
  
https://linux.die.net/man/2/preadv  
  
Name  
readv, writev, preadv, pwritev - read or write data into multiple buffers  
  
Synopsis  
  
```  
#include <sys/uio.h>  
  
ssize_t readv(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);  
  
ssize_t writev(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt);  
  
ssize_t preadv(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt,  
               off_t offset);  
  
ssize_t pwritev(int fd, const struct iovec *iov, int iovcnt,  
                off_t offset);  
```  
  
Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see feature_test_macros(7)):  
  
```  
preadv(), pwritev(): _BSD_SOURCE  
```  
  
Description  
The readv() system call reads iovcnt buffers from the file associated with the file descriptor fd into the buffers described by iov ("scatter input").  
  
The writev() system call writes iovcnt buffers of data described by iov to the file associated with the file descriptor fd ("gather output").  
  
The pointer iov points to an array of iovec structures, defined in <sys/uio.h> as:  
  
```  
struct iovec {  
    void  *iov_base;    /* Starting address */  
    size_t iov_len;     /* Number of bytes to transfer */  
};  
```  
  
The readv() system call works just like read(2) except that multiple buffers are filled.  
The writev() system call works just like write(2) except that multiple buffers are written out.  
  
Buffers are processed in array order. This means that readv() completely fills iov[0] before proceeding to iov[1], and so on. (If there is insufficient data, then not all buffers pointed to by iov may be filled.) Similarly, writev() writes out the entire contents of iov[0] before proceeding to iov[1], and so on.  
  
The data transfers performed by readv() and writev() are atomic: the data written by writev() is written as a single block that is not intermingled with output from writes in other processes (but see pipe(7) for an exception); analogously, readv() is guaranteed to read a contiguous block of data from the file, regardless of read operations performed in other threads or processes that have file descriptors referring to the same open file description (see open(2)).  
  
preadv() and pwritev()  
  
The preadv() system call combines the functionality of readv() and pread(2). It performs the same task as readv(), but adds a fourth argument, offset, which specifies the file offset at which the input operation is to be performed.  
The pwritev() system call combines the functionality of writev() and pwrite(2). It performs the same task as writev(), but adds a fourth argument, offset, which specifies the file offset at which the output operation is to be performed.  
  
The file offset is not changed by these system calls. The file referred to by fd must be capable of seeking.  
  
Return Value  
  
   
On success, readv() and preadv() return the number of bytes read; writev() and pwritev() return the number of bytes written. On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set appropriately.  
  
Errors  
The errors are as given for read(2) and write(2). Furthermore, preadv() and pwritev() can also fail for the same reasons as lseek(2). Additionally, the following error is defined:  
  
EINVAL  
The sum of the iov_len values overflows an ssize_t value. Or, the vector count iovcnt is less than zero or greater than the permitted maximum.  
  
Versions  
preadv() and pwritev() first appeared in Linux 2.6.30; library support was added in glibc 2.10.
