## 背景    
https://www.percona.com/blog/2021/01/22/postgresql-on-arm-based-aws-ec2-instances-is-it-any-good/  
  
arm比x64便宜 25%, 同时arm性能比x86好 15~20%(大多数场景)     
  
TPCB  
- Read-Write Without Checksum: +19%  
- Read-Write With Checksum: +19%  
- Read-Only Without Checksum: +30%  
- Read-Only With Checksum: +30%  
  
Testing With sysbench-tpcc  
- In-memory, 16 threads: 15.5%  
- In-memory, 32 threads: 8%  
- In-memory, 64 threads: 4.5%  
- In-memory, 128 threads: 1.4%  
  
Not everything we measured is favorable to the Graviton2-based instance. In the IO-bound tests (~200G dataset, 200 warehouses, uniform distribution), we saw less difference between the two instances, and at 64 and 128 threads, regular m5d instance performed better.   
A possible reason for this, especially the significant meltdown at 128 threads for m6gd.8xlarge, is that it lacks the second drive that m5d.8xlarge has. There’s no perfectly comparable couple of instances available currently, so we consider this a fair comparison; each instance type has an advantage. More testing and profiling is necessary to correctly identify the cause, as we expected local drives to negligibly affect the tests. IO-bound testing with EBS can potentially be performed to try and remove the local drives from the equation.  
  
There were not many cases where the ARM instance becomes slower than the x86 instance in the tests we performed. The test results were consistent throughout the testing of the last couple of days. While ARM-based instance is 25 percent cheaper, it is able to show a 15-20% performance gain in most of the tests over the corresponding x86 based instances. So ARM-based instances are giving conclusively better price-performance in all aspects. We should expect more and more cloud providers to provide ARM-based instances in the future. Please let us know if you wish to see any different type of benchmark tests.
