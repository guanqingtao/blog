当数据库系统表的索引损坏后, 数据库无法启动, 怎么修复?  
  
由于损坏的是索引而不是数据, 所以是有机会修复的, 方法很简单:  
  
1、单用户启动, 不加载索引.  
  
```  
postgres --single -P -D /your/own/pgdata your_faulty_database  
```  
  
2、执行```reindex system xx;```  
  
## 参考  
man postgres  
  
```  
       -P  
           Ignore system indexes when reading system tables, but still update the indexes when modifying the tables. This is useful when recovering from damaged system indexes.  
  
   Options for Single-User Mode  
       The following options only apply to the single-user mode (see SINGLE-USER MODE).  
  
       --single  
           Selects the single-user mode. This must be the first argument on the command line.  
  
       database  
           Specifies the name of the database to be accessed. This must be the last argument on the command line. If it is omitted it defaults to the user name.  
  
       -E  
           Echo all commands to standard output before executing them.  
  
       -j  
           Use semicolon followed by two newlines, rather than just newline, as the command entry terminator.  
  
       -r filename  
           Send all server log output to filename. This option is only honored when supplied as a command-line option.  
```  
  
```  
SINGLE-USER MODE  
       To start a single-user mode server, use a command like  
  
           postgres --single -D /usr/local/pgsql/data other-options my_database  
  
       Provide the correct path to the database directory with -D, or make sure that the environment variable PGDATA is set. Also specify the name of the particular database you want to work in.  
  
       Normally, the single-user mode server treats newline as the command entry terminator; there is no intelligence about semicolons, as there is in psql. To continue a command across multiple lines, you  
       must type backslash just before each newline except the last one. The backslash and adjacent newline are both dropped from the input command. Note that this will happen even when within a string  
       literal or comment.  
  
       But if you use the -j command line switch, a single newline does not terminate command entry; instead, the sequence semicolon-newline-newline does. That is, type a semicolon immediately followed by  
       a completely empty line. Backslash-newline is not treated specially in this mode. Again, there is no intelligence about such a sequence appearing within a string literal or comment.  
  
       In either input mode, if you type a semicolon that is not just before or part of a command entry terminator, it is considered a command separator. When you do type a command entry terminator, the  
       multiple statements you've entered will be executed as a single transaction.  
  
       To quit the session, type EOF (Control+D, usually). If you've entered any text since the last command entry terminator, then EOF will be taken as a command entry terminator, and another EOF will be  
       needed to exit.  
  
       Note that the single-user mode server does not provide sophisticated line-editing features (no command history, for example). Single-user mode also does not do any background processing, such as  
       automatic checkpoints or replication.
