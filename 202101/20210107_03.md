Detect the deadlocks between backends and the startup process.  
  
The deadlocks that the recovery conflict on lock is involved in can  
happen between hot-standby backends and the startup process.  
If a backend takes an access exclusive lock on the table and which  
finally triggers the deadlock, that deadlock can be detected  
as expected. On the other hand, previously, if the startup process  
took an access exclusive lock and which finally triggered the deadlock,  
that deadlock could not be detected and could remain even after  
deadlock_timeout passed. This is a bug.  
  
The cause of this bug was that the code for handling the recovery  
conflict on lock didn't take care of deadlock case at all. It assumed  
that deadlocks involving the startup process and backends were able  
to be detected by the deadlock detector invoked within backends.  
But this assumption was incorrect. The startup process also should  
have invoked the deadlock detector if necessary.  
  
To fix this bug, this commit makes the startup process invoke  
the deadlock detector if deadlock_timeout is reached while handling  
the recovery conflict on lock. Specifically, in that case, the startup  
process requests all the backends holding the conflicting locks to  
check themselves for deadlocks.  
  
Back-patch to v9.6. v9.5 has also this bug, but per discussion we decided  
not to back-patch the fix to v9.5. Because v9.5 doesn't have some  
infrastructure codes (e.g., 37c54863cf) that this bug fix patch depends on.  
We can apply those codes for the back-patch, but since the next minor  
version release is the final one for v9.5, it's risky to do that. If we  
unexpectedly introduce new bug to v9.5 by the back-patch, there is no  
chance to fix that. We determined that the back-patch to v9.5 would give  
more risk than gain.
