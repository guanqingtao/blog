## 背景     
关闭微软office 2021 autoupdate自动启动.  
  
查看服务  
  
```  
launchctl list  
PID	Status	Label  
-	0	com.apple.SafariHistoryServiceAgent  
1818	0	com.apple.progressd  
-	0	com.google.keystone.user.xpcservice  
  
....  
```  
  
搜索microsoft服务  
  
```  
launchctl list|grep -i mic  
-	0	com.microsoft.update.agent  
```  
  
禁止`com.microsoft.update.agent`服务  
  
```  
launchctl disable com.microsoft.update.agent  
Unrecognized target specifier, did you mean  
gui/501/com.microsoft.update.agent  
  
Usage: launchctl disable <service-target>  
<service-target> takes a form of <domain-target>/<service-id>.  
Please refer to `man launchctl` for explanation of the <domain-target> specifiers.  
```  
  
由于有重名可能, 使用几种方法标识`com.microsoft.update.agent`服务  
  
```  
man launchctl  
  
  
  
SUBCOMMANDS  
     launchctl allows for detailed examination of launchd's data structures. The fundamental structures are domains, services, and endpoints. A  
     domain manages the execution policy for a collection of services.  A service may be thought of as a virtual process that is always  
     available to be spawned in response to demand. Each service has a collection of endpoints, and sending a message to one of those endpoints  
     will cause the service to launch on demand. Domains advertise these endpoints in a shared namespace and may be thought of as synonymous  
     with Mach bootstrap subsets.  
  
     Many subcommands in launchctl take a specifier which indicates the target domain or service for the subcommand. This specifier may take one  
     of the following forms:  
  
     system/[service-name]  
              Targets the system domain or a service within the system domain. The system domain manages the root Mach bootstrap and is  
              considered a privileged execution context. Anyone may read or query the system domain, but root privileges are required to make  
              modifications.  
  
     user/<uid>/[service-name]  
              Targets the user domain for the given UID or a service within that domain. A user domain may exist independently of a logged-in  
              user. User domains do not exist on iOS.  
  
     login/<asid>/[service-name]  
              Targets a user-login domain or service within that domain. A user-login domain is created when the user logs in at the GUI and is  
              identified by the audit session identifier associated with that login. If a user domain has an associated login domain, the print  
              subcommand will display the ASID of that login domain. User-login domains do not exist on iOS.  
  
     gui/<uid>/[service-name]  
              Another form of the login specifier. Rather than specifying a user-login domain by its ASID, this specifier targets the domain  
              based on which user it is associated with and is generally more convenient.  
  
              Note: GUI domains and user domains share many resources. For the purposes of the Mach bootstrap name lookups, they are "flat", so  
              they share the same set of registered names. But they still have discrete sets of services. So when printing the user domain's  
              contents, you may see many Mach bootstrap name registrations from services that exist in the GUI domain for that user, but you  
              will not see the services themselves in that list.  
  
     pid/<pid>/[service-name]  
              Targets the domain for the given PID or a service within that domain. Each process on the system will have a PID domain associated  
              with it that consists of the XPC services visible to that process which can be reached with xpc_connection_create(3).  
  
     For instance, when referring to a service with the identifier com.apple.example loaded into the GUI domain of a user with UID 501,  
     domain-target is gui/501/, service-name is com.apple.example, and service-target is gui/501/com.apple.example.  
```  
  
使用uid标识  
       
```

digoaldeMacBook-Pro:~ digoal$ id digoal  
uid=501(digoal) gid=20(staff) groups=20(staff),12(everyone),61(localaccounts),79(_appserverusr),80(admin),81(_appserveradm),98(_lpadmin),701(com.apple.sharepoint.group.1),33(_appstore),100(_lpoperator),204(_developer),250(_analyticsusers),395(com.apple.access_ftp),398(com.apple.access_screensharing),399(com.apple.access_ssh),400(com.apple.access_remote_ae)  
```  
  
disable `com.microsoft.update.agent` 服务  
  
```  
launchctl disable gui/501/com.microsoft.update.agent  
digoaldeMacBook-Pro:~ digoal$ launchctl list|grep -i mic  
-	0	com.microsoft.update.agent  
```  
  
重启后`com.microsoft.update.agent`就不会自动启动了
