## 背景     
PostgreSQL 17 分区表支持生成列(Identity columns).      
  
```  
GENERATED { ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT } AS IDENTITY [ ( sequence_options ) ]   
```  
  
This clause creates the column as an identity column. It will have an implicit sequence attached to it and the column in new rows will automatically have values from the sequence assigned to it. Such a column is implicitly NOT NULL.  
  
The clauses ALWAYS and BY DEFAULT determine how explicitly user-specified values are handled in INSERT and UPDATE commands.  
  
In an INSERT command, if ALWAYS is selected, a user-specified value is only accepted if the INSERT statement specifies OVERRIDING SYSTEM VALUE. If BY DEFAULT is selected, then the user-specified value takes precedence. See INSERT for details. (In the COPY command, user-specified values are always used regardless of this setting.)  
  
In an UPDATE command, if ALWAYS is selected, any update of the column to any value other than DEFAULT will be rejected. If BY DEFAULT is selected, the column can be updated normally. (There is no OVERRIDING clause for the UPDATE command.)  
  
The optional sequence_options clause can be used to override the options of the sequence. See CREATE SEQUENCE for details.  
  
  
```  
-   Identity columns are currently not supported for partitioned tables.  
+   Partitions inherit identity columns from the partitioned table.  They  
+   cannot have their own identity columns.  The properties of a given identity  
+   column are consistent across all the partitions in the partition hierarchy.  
```

Support identity columns in partitioned tables  
  
Previously, identity columns were disallowed on partitioned tables.  
(The reason was mainly that no one had gotten around to working  
through all the details to make it work.)  This makes it work now.  
  
Some details on the behavior:  
  
* A newly created partition inherits identity property  
  
  The partitions of a partitioned table are integral part of the  
  partitioned table.  A partition inherits identity columns from the  
  partitioned table.  An identity column of a partition shares the  
  identity space with the corresponding column of the partitioned  
  table.  In other words, the same identity column across all  
  partitions of a partitioned table share the same identity space.  
  This is effected by sharing the same underlying sequence.  
  
  When INSERTing directly into a partition, the sequence associated  
  with the topmost partitioned table is used to calculate the value of  
  the corresponding identity column.  
  
  In regular inheritance, identity columns and their properties in a  
  child table are independent of those in its parent tables.  A child  
  table does not inherit identity columns or their properties  
  automatically from the parent.  (This is unchanged.)  
  
* Attached partition inherits identity column  
  
  A table being attached as a partition inherits the identity property  
  from the partitioned table.  This should be fine since we expect  
  that the partition table's column has the same type as the  
  partitioned table's corresponding column.  If the table being  
  attached is a partitioned table, the identity properties are  
  propagated down its partition hierarchy.  
  
  An identity column in the partitioned table is also marked as NOT  
  NULL.  The corresponding column in the partition needs to be marked  
  as NOT NULL for the attach to succeed.  
  
* Drop identity property when detaching partition  
  
  A partition's identity column shares the identity space  
  (i.e. underlying sequence) as the corresponding column of the  
  partitioned table.  If a partition is detached it can longer share  
  the identity space as before.  Hence the identity columns of the  
  partition being detached loose their identity property.  
  
  When identity of a column of a regular table is dropped it retains  
  the NOT NULL constraint that came with the identity property.  
  Similarly the columns of the partition being detached retain the NOT  
  NULL constraints that came with identity property, even though the  
  identity property itself is lost.  
  
  The sequence associated with the identity property is linked to the  
  partitioned table (and not the partition being detached).  That  
  sequence is not dropped as part of detach operation.  
  
* Partitions with their own identity columns are not allowed.  
  
* The usual ALTER operations (add identity column, add identity  
  property to existing column, alter properties of an indentity  
  column, drop identity property) are supported for partitioned  
  tables.  Changing a column only in a partitioned table or a  
  partition is not allowed; the change needs to be applied to the  
  whole partition hierarchy.
