Add Result Cache executor node (take 2)  
  
Here we add a new executor node type named "Result Cache".  The planner  
can include this node type in the plan to have the executor cache the  
results from the inner side of parameterized nested loop joins.  This  
allows caching of tuples for sets of parameters so that in the event that  
the node sees the same parameter values again, it can just return the  
cached tuples instead of rescanning the inner side of the join all over  
again.  Internally, result cache uses a hash table in order to quickly  
find tuples that have been previously cached.  
  
For certain data sets, this can significantly improve the performance of  
joins.  The best cases for using this new node type are for join problems  
where a large portion of the tuples from the inner side of the join have  
no join partner on the outer side of the join.  In such cases, hash join  
would have to hash values that are never looked up, thus bloating the hash  
table and possibly causing it to multi-batch.  Merge joins would have to  
skip over all of the unmatched rows.  If we use a nested loop join with a  
result cache, then we only cache tuples that have at least one join  
partner on the outer side of the join.  The benefits of using a  
parameterized nested loop with a result cache increase when there are  
fewer distinct values being looked up and the number of lookups of each  
value is large.  Also, hash probes to lookup the cache can be much faster  
than the hash probe in a hash join as it's common that the result cache's  
hash table is much smaller than the hash join's due to result cache only  
caching useful tuples rather than all tuples from the inner side of the  
join.  This variation in hash probe performance is more significant when  
the hash join's hash table no longer fits into the CPU's L3 cache, but the  
result cache's hash table does.  The apparent "random" access of hash  
buckets with each hash probe can cause a poor L3 cache hit ratio for large  
hash tables.  Smaller hash tables generally perform better.  
  
The hash table used for the cache limits itself to not exceeding work_mem  
* hash_mem_multiplier in size.  We maintain a dlist of keys for this cache  
and when we're adding new tuples and realize we've exceeded the memory  
budget, we evict cache entries starting with the least recently used ones  
until we have enough memory to add the new tuples to the cache.  
  
For parameterized nested loop joins, we now consider using one of these  
result cache nodes in between the nested loop node and its inner node.  We  
determine when this might be useful based on cost, which is primarily  
driven off of what the expected cache hit ratio will be.  Estimating the  
cache hit ratio relies on having good distinct estimates on the nested  
loop's parameters.  
  
For now, the planner will only consider using a result cache for  
parameterized nested loop joins.  This works for both normal joins and  
also for LATERAL type joins to subqueries.  It is possible to use this new  
node for other uses in the future.  For example, to cache results from  
correlated subqueries.  However, that's not done here due to some  
difficulties obtaining a distinct estimation on the outer plan to  
calculate the estimated cache hit ratio.  Currently we plan the inner plan  
before planning the outer plan so there is no good way to know if a result  
cache would be useful or not since we can't estimate the number of times  
the subplan will be called until the outer plan is generated.  
  
The functionality being added here is newly introducing a dependency on  
the return value of estimate_num_groups() during the join search.  
Previously, during the join search, we only ever needed to perform  
selectivity estimations.  With this commit, we need to use  
estimate_num_groups() in order to estimate what the hit ratio on the  
result cache will be.   In simple terms, if we expect 10 distinct values  
and we expect 1000 outer rows, then we'll estimate the hit ratio to be  
99%.  Since cache hits are very cheap compared to scanning the underlying  
nodes on the inner side of the nested loop join, then this will  
significantly reduce the planner's cost for the join.   However, it's  
fairly easy to see here that things will go bad when estimate_num_groups()  
incorrectly returns a value that's significantly lower than the actual  
number of distinct values.  If this happens then that may cause us to make  
use of a nested loop join with a result cache instead of some other join  
type, such as a merge or hash join.  Our distinct estimations have been  
known to be a source of trouble in the past, so the extra reliance on them  
here could cause the planner to choose slower plans than it did previous  
to having this feature.  Distinct estimations are also fairly hard to  
estimate accurately when several tables have been joined already or when a  
WHERE clause filters out a set of values that are correlated to the  
expressions we're estimating the number of distinct value for.  
  
For now, the costing we perform during query planning for result caches  
does put quite a bit of faith in the distinct estimations being accurate.  
When these are accurate then we should generally see faster execution  
times for plans containing a result cache.  However, in the real world, we  
may find that we need to either change the costings to put less trust in  
the distinct estimations being accurate or perhaps even disable this  
feature by default.  There's always an element of risk when we teach the  
query planner to do new tricks that it decides to use that new trick at  
the wrong time and causes a regression.  Users may opt to get the old  
behavior by turning the feature off using the enable_resultcache GUC.  
Currently, this is enabled by default.  It remains to be seen if we'll  
maintain that setting for the release.  
  
Additionally, the name "Result Cache" is the best name I could think of  
for this new node at the time I started writing the patch.  Nobody seems  
to strongly dislike the name. A few people did suggest other names but no  
other name seemed to dominate in the brief discussion that there was about  
names. Let's allow the beta period to see if the current name pleases  
enough people.  If there's some consensus on a better name, then we can  
change it before the release.  Please see the 2nd discussion link below  
for the discussion on the "Result Cache" name.

Change the name of the Result Cache node to Memoize  
  
"Result Cache" was never a great name for this node, but nobody managed  
to come up with another name that anyone liked enough.  That was until  
David Johnston mentioned "Node Memoization", which Tom Lane revised to  
just "Memoize".  People seem to like "Memoize", so let's do the rename.

enable_material (boolean)   
- Enables or disables the query planner's use of materialization. It is impossible to suppress materialization entirely, but turning this variable off prevents the planner from inserting materialize nodes except in cases where it is required for correctness. The default is on.  
  
enable_memoize (boolean)   
- Enables or disables the query planner's use of memoize plans for caching results from parameterized scans inside nested-loop joins. This plan type allows scans to the underlying plans to be skipped when the results for the current parameters are already in the cache. Less commonly looked up results may be evicted from the cache when more space is required for new entries. The default is on.
