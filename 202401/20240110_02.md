## 背景

PQchangePassword   
- Changes a PostgreSQL password.  
  
PGresult *PQchangePassword(PGconn *conn, const char *user, const char *passwd);  
This function uses PQencryptPasswordConn to build and execute the command ALTER USER ... PASSWORD '...', thereby changing the user's password. It exists for the same reason as PQencryptPasswordConn, but is more convenient as it both builds and runs the command for you. PQencryptPasswordConn is passed a NULL for the algorithm argument, hence encryption is done according to the server's password_encryption setting.  
  
The user and passwd arguments are the SQL name of the target user, and the new cleartext password.  
  
Returns a PGresult pointer representing the result of the ALTER USER command, or a null pointer if the routine failed before issuing any command. The PQresultStatus function should be called to check the return value for any errors (including the value of a null pointer, in which case it will return PGRES_FATAL_ERROR). Use PQerrorMessage to get more information about such errors.

Add new function, PQchangePassword(), to libpq  
  
Essentially this moves the non-interactive part of psql's "\password"  
command into an exported client function. The password is not sent to the  
server in cleartext because it is "encrypted" (in the case of scram and md5  
it is actually hashed, but we have called these encrypted passwords for a  
long time now) on the client side. This is good because it ensures the  
cleartext password is never known by the server, and therefore won't end up  
in logs, pg_stat displays, etc.  
  
In other words, it exists for the same reason as PQencryptPasswordConn(), but  
is more convenient as it both builds and runs the "ALTER USER" command for  
you. PQchangePassword() uses PQencryptPasswordConn() to do the password  
encryption. PQencryptPasswordConn() is passed a NULL for the algorithm  
argument, hence encryption is done according to the server's  
password_encryption setting.  
  
Also modify the psql client to use the new function. That provides a builtin  
test case. Ultimately drivers built on top of libpq should expose this  
function and its use should be generally encouraged over doing ALTER USER  
directly for password changes.
