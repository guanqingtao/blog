## 背景                               
https://github.com/sunng87/pgwire    
    
PostgreSQL wire protocol implemented as a rust library.    
    
适合需要编写兼容PostgreSQL交互协议的服务的场景. 例如cockroach数据库的交互协议.

Build Postgres compatible access layer for your data service.    
    
This library implements PostgreSQL Wire Protocol, and provide essential APIs to    
write PostgreSQL comptible servers and clients.    
    
This library is a work in progress and in its relatively early stage. There is    
no guarantee for API stability. I'm constantly introducing break changes during    
this period. And also sorry for lack of API docs, examples may get you familiar    
with its usage.

## About Postgres Wire Protocol    
    
Postgres Wire Protocol is a relatively general-purpose Layer-7 protocol. There    
are 3 parts of the protocol:    
    
- Startup: client-server handshake and authentication.    
- Simple Query: The text-based query protocol of postgresql. Query are provided    
  as string, and server is allowed to stream data in response.    
- Extended Query: A new sub-protocol for query which has ability to cache the    
  query on server-side and reuse it with new parameters. The response part is    
  identical to Simple Query.    
    
Also note that Postgres Wire Protocol has no semantics about SQL, so literally    
you can use any query language, data formats or even natural language to    
interact with the backend.    
    
The response are always encoded as data row format. And there is a field    
description as header of the data to describe its name, type and format.    
    
    
## Usage    
    
### Server/Backend    
    
To use `pgwire` in your server application, you will need to implement two key    
components: **startup processor** and **query processor**. For query    
processing, there are two kinds of queries: simple and extended. By adding    
`SimpleQueryHandler` to your application, you will get `psql` command-line tool    
compatibility. And for more language drivers and additional prepared statement,    
binary encoding support, `ExtendedQueryHandler` is required.    
    
Examples are provided to demo the very basic usage of `pgwire` on server side:    
    
- `examples/sqlite.rs`: uses an in-memory sqlite database at its core and serves    
  it with postgresql protocol. This is a full example with both simple and    
  extended query implementation.    
- `examples/gluesql.rs`: uses an in-memory    
  [gluesql](https://github.com/gluesql/gluesql) at its core and serves    
  it with postgresql protocol.    
- `examples/server.rs`: demos a server that always returns fixed results.    
- `examples/secure_server.rs`: demos a server with ssl support and always    
  returns fixed results.    
- `examples/scram.rs`: demos how to configure more secure authentication    
  mechanism:    
  [SCRAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_Challenge_Response_Authentication_Mechanism)    
- `examples/datafusion.rs`: demos a postgres compatible server backed by    
  datafusion query engine. This example allows you to `LOAD` csv files as    
  datafusion table and run `SELECT` queries on them.    
    
### Client/Frontend    
    
I think in most case you do not need pgwire to build a postgresql client,    
existing postgresql client like    
[rust-postgres](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-postgres) should fit your    
scenarios. Please rise an issue if there is a scenario.
