## 背景    
pgxman这个项目尝试做成一个共享项目, 大家可以根据模板写出yaml文件, 把PG插件的编译脚本集中后, 由pgxman来管理插件.

With pgxman, we've streamlined the installation process to one simple step: run pgxman install [extension name].  
  
pgxman integrates with the system package manager, ensuring the correct versions are installed without extra packages from any shared dependencies between extensions. pgxman’s automated build system creates APT packages for each Postgres version, platform, and OS supported by the extension. Extensions are built from a buildkit formula, written in YAML, and are contributed through GitHub.  
  
目前已有的插件管理脚本如下:

相比于pgxman, 其实使用pgxn也蛮好管理的.   例如:  
  
```

# pgxman - PostgreSQL Extension Manager  
  
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/pgxman/pgxman.svg)](https://github.com/pgxman/pgxman/releases)  
  
pgxman is npm for Postgres extensions. pgxman simplifies the discovery and use of extensions so modern hackers  
can easily enhance the capabilities of their applications.  
  
Instead of managing extension versions, build & run dependencies, operating system, platform architecture, pgxman  
automatically detects and streamlines extension operations (xOps) based on the local development environment.  
  
With pgxman, we've streamlined the installation process to one simple step: run `pgxman install [extension name]`.  
  
pgxman integrates with the system package manager, ensuring the correct versions are installed without extra packages  
from any shared dependencies between extensions. pgxman’s automated build system creates  
[APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(software)) packages for each Postgres version, platform, and OS supported  
by the extension. Extensions are built from a buildkit formula, written in YAML, and are contributed  
[through GitHub](https://github.com/pgxman/buildkit).  
  
## More Documentation  
  
Try `pgxman help`, `man pgxman`, or [read our documentation](https://docs.pgxman.com).  
  
## Installation  
  
Run:  
  
```sh  
# with homebrew  
brew install pgxman/tap/pgxman  
# without homebrew  
curl -sfL https://install.pgx.sh | sh -  
```  
  
For more options, see [our installation documentation](https://docs.pgxman.com/installing_pgxman).  
  
## Quickstart  
  
### `search`  
  
Find extensions with `pgxman search`:  
  
```sh  
pgxman search fdw  
```  
  
### `install`  
  
To install an extension, say `pgvector`, run:  
  
```sh  
pgxman install pgvector  
```  
  
pgxman will automatically detect your local install of Postgres (or, on MacOS, will [use a container](https://docs.pgxman.com/container)).  
  
You can specify multiple extensions, specific extension versions, and a PG version:  
  
```sh  
pgxman install --pg 15 pgvector=0.5.1 pg_ivm=1.7.0  
```  
  
You can also utilize a [pack file](https://docs.pgxman.com/spec/pack) to install multiple extensions at once:  
  
```sh  
pgxman pack install # installs from pgxman.yaml from current directory  
pgxman pack install -f /path/to/pgxman.yaml  
```  
  
Once installed, restart Postgres, then use `CREATE EXTENSION`.  
  
### `init`, `build`  
  
[Please refer to our docs for how to build an extension for pgxman](https://docs.pgxman.com/building_an_extension).  
  
## How it works  
  
pgxman's build system works with your system package manager. The buildkit  
specifies how to build each extension and builds it for each package manager.  
When a buildkit is added or updated, a build is conducted and the packages are  
stored in pgxman's repositories.  
  
When installing an extension, pgxman's package repository is used to install  
the packages into your system. This way, pgxman is able to handle dependency  
management, installation, and uninstallation through your system's package  
manager.  
  
pgxman itself is either installed as an apt package or via homebrew.  
  
For more details, see [how it works](https://docs.pgxman.com/how_it_works) in the  
documentation.  
  
## License  
  
The pgxman client is licensed under the [FSL](LICENSE.md), which, in short, means  
pgxman is open for all internal, non-competing usage. To learn more about the  
FSL, please see [fsl.software](https://fsl.software). As stated:

We consider any Postgres service provider using pgxman as part of their service  
to be a Competing Usage. However, we encourage widespread adoption of pgxman and welcome  
any service provider to contact us at `pgxman [at] hydra [dot] so` to obtain a  
license for usage as part of your service. Our main concern is assuring the pgxman  
service can scale to the needs of your service.

     bloom provides an index access method based on Bloom filters.  
    
     A Bloom filter is a space-efficient data structure that is used to test  
     whether an element is a member of a set. In the case of an index access  
     method, it allows fast exclusion of non-matching tuples via signatures  
     whose size is determined at index creation.  
    
     A signature is a lossy representation of the indexed attribute(s), and  
     as such is prone to reporting false positives; that is, it may be  
     reported that an element is in the set, when it is not. So index search  
     results must always be rechecked using the actual attribute values from  
     the heap entry. Larger signatures reduce the odds of a false positive  
     and thus reduce the number of useless heap visits, but of course also  
     make the index larger and hence slower to scan.  
    
     This type of index is most useful when a table has many attributes and  
     queries test arbitrary combinations of them. A traditional btree index  
     is faster than a bloom index, but it can require many btree indexes to  
     support all possible queries where one needs only a single bloom index.  
     Note however that bloom indexes only support equality queries, whereas  
     btree indexes can also perform inequality and range searches.  
    
  F.7.1. Parameters  
    
     A bloom index accepts the following parameters in its WITH clause:  
    
     length  
            Length of each signature (index entry) in bits. It is rounded up  
            to the nearest multiple of 16. The default is 80 bits and the  
            maximum is 4096.  
    
     col1 -- col32  
            Number of bits generated for each index column. Each parameter's  
            name refers to the number of the index column that it controls.  
            The default is 2 bits and the maximum is 4095. Parameters for  
            index columns not actually used are ignored.  
    
  F.7.2. Examples  
    
     This is an example of creating a bloom index:  
  CREATE INDEX bloomidx ON tbloom USING bloom (i1,i2,i3)  
         WITH (length=80, col1=2, col2=2, col3=4);  
    
     The index is created with a signature length of 80 bits, with  
     attributes i1 and i2 mapped to 2 bits, and attribute i3 mapped to 4  
     bits. We could have omitted the length, col1, and col2 specifications  
     since those have the default values.  
    
     Here is a more complete example of bloom index definition and usage, as  
     well as a comparison with equivalent btree indexes. The bloom index is  
     considerably smaller than the btree index, and can perform better.  
  =# CREATE TABLE tbloom AS  
     SELECT  
       (random() * 1000000)::int as i1,  
       (random() * 1000000)::int as i2,  
       (random() * 1000000)::int as i3,  
       (random() * 1000000)::int as i4,  
       (random() * 1000000)::int as i5,  
       (random() * 1000000)::int as i6  
     FROM  
    generate_series(1,10000000);  
  SELECT 10000000  
    
     A sequential scan over this large table takes a long time:  
  =# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM tbloom WHERE i2 = 898732 AND i5 = 123451;  
                                                QUERY PLAN  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  ----------------------  
   Seq Scan on tbloom  (cost=0.00..2137.14 rows=3 width=24) (actual time=16.971..1  
  6.971 rows=0 loops=1)  
     Filter: ((i2 = 898732) AND (i5 = 123451))  
     Rows Removed by Filter: 100000  
   Planning Time: 0.346 ms  
   Execution Time: 16.988 ms  
  (5 rows)  
    
     Even with the btree index defined the result will still be a sequential  
     scan:  
  =# CREATE INDEX btreeidx ON tbloom (i1, i2, i3, i4, i5, i6);  
  CREATE INDEX  
  =# SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('btreeidx'));  
   pg_size_pretty

   Planning Time: 0.138 ms  
   Execution Time: 12.817 ms  
  (5 rows)  
    
     Having the bloom index defined on the table is better than btree in  
     handling this type of search:  
  =# CREATE INDEX bloomidx ON tbloom USING bloom (i1, i2, i3, i4, i5, i6);  
  CREATE INDEX  
  =# SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('bloomidx'));

                                                       QUERY PLAN  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  -------------------------------------  
   Bitmap Heap Scan on tbloom  (cost=1792.00..1799.69 rows=2 width=24) (actual tim

           Index Cond: ((i2 = 898732) AND (i5 = 123451))  
   Planning Time: 0.099 ms  
   Execution Time: 0.408 ms  
  (8 rows)  
    
     Now, the main problem with the btree search is that btree is  
     inefficient when the search conditions do not constrain the leading  
     index column(s). A better strategy for btree is to create a separate  
     index on each column. Then the planner will choose something like this:  
  =# CREATE INDEX btreeidx1 ON tbloom (i1);  
  CREATE INDEX  
  =# CREATE INDEX btreeidx2 ON tbloom (i2);  
  CREATE INDEX  
  =# CREATE INDEX btreeidx3 ON tbloom (i3);  
  CREATE INDEX  
  =# CREATE INDEX btreeidx4 ON tbloom (i4);  
  CREATE INDEX  
  =# CREATE INDEX btreeidx5 ON tbloom (i5);  
  CREATE INDEX  
  =# CREATE INDEX btreeidx6 ON tbloom (i6);  
  CREATE INDEX  
  =# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM tbloom WHERE i2 = 898732 AND i5 = 123451;  
                                                          QUERY PLAN  
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
  -------------------------------------------  
   Bitmap Heap Scan on tbloom  (cost=24.34..32.03 rows=2 width=24) (actual time=0.  
  028..0.029 rows=0 loops=1)  
     Recheck Cond: ((i5 = 123451) AND (i2 = 898732))  
     ->  BitmapAnd  (cost=24.34..24.34 rows=2 width=0) (actual time=0.027..0.027 r  
  ows=0 loops=1)  
           ->  Bitmap Index Scan on btreeidx5  (cost=0.00..12.04 rows=500 width=0)  
   (actual time=0.026..0.026 rows=0 loops=1)  
                 Index Cond: (i5 = 123451)  
           ->  Bitmap Index Scan on btreeidx2  (cost=0.00..12.04 rows=500 width=0)  
   (never executed)  
                 Index Cond: (i2 = 898732)  
   Planning Time: 0.491 ms  
   Execution Time: 0.055 ms  
  (9 rows)  
    
     Although this query runs much faster than with either of the single  
     indexes, we pay a penalty in index size. Each of the single-column  
     btree indexes occupies 2 MB, so the total space needed is 12 MB, eight  
     times the space used by the bloom index.  
    
  F.7.3. Operator Class Interface  
    
     An operator class for bloom indexes requires only a hash function for  
     the indexed data type and an equality operator for searching. This  
     example shows the operator class definition for the text data type:  
  CREATE OPERATOR CLASS text_ops  
  DEFAULT FOR TYPE text USING bloom AS  
      OPERATOR    1   =(text, text),  
      FUNCTION    1   hashtext(text);  
    
  F.7.4. Limitations  
    
       * Only operator classes for int4 and text are included with the  
         module.  
       * Only the = operator is supported for search. But it is possible to  
         add support for arrays with union and intersection operations in  
         the future.  
       * bloom access method doesn't support UNIQUE indexes.  
       * bloom access method doesn't support searching for NULL values.
