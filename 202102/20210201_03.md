## 背景  
PostgreSQL 14 SQL标准增强, 图式搜索增加:  广度优先、深度优先语法, 循环语法 - breadth- or depth-first search orders and detect cycles.  
  
with recursive 支持 SEARCH and CYCLE 语法, 增强了PG在图中的使用.

SEARCH and CYCLE clauses  
  
This adds the SQL standard feature that adds the SEARCH and CYCLE  
clauses to recursive queries to be able to do produce breadth- or  
depth-first search orders and detect cycles.  These clauses can be  
rewritten into queries using existing syntax, and that is what this  
patch does in the rewriter.

另外需要注意的是， cycly默认已经使用了深度优先， 所以如果使用了cycle就不要重复使用深度优先语法了。   
  
The cycle path column is computed in the same way as the depth-first ordering column show in the previous section. A query can have both a SEARCH and a CYCLE clause, but a depth-first search specification and a cycle detection specification would create redundant computations, so it's more efficient to just use the CYCLE clause and order by the path column. If breadth-first ordering is wanted, then specifying both SEARCH and CYCLE can be useful.
