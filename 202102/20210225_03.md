## 背景        
https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=e5d8a999030418a1b9e53d5f15ccaca7ed674877    
    
```    
Use full 64-bit XIDs in deleted nbtree pages.    
    
Otherwise we risk "leaking" deleted pages by making them non-recyclable    
indefinitely.  Commit 6655a729 did the same thing for deleted pages in    
GiST indexes.  That work was used as a starting point here.    
    
Stop storing an XID indicating the oldest bpto.xact across all deleted    
though unrecycled pages in nbtree metapages.  There is no longer any    
reason to care about that condition/the oldest XID.  It only ever made    
sense when wraparound was something _bt_vacuum_needs_cleanup() had to    
consider.    
    
The btm_oldest_btpo_xact metapage field has been repurposed and renamed.    
It is now btm_last_cleanup_num_delpages, which is used to remember how    
many non-recycled deleted pages remain from the last VACUUM (in practice    
its value is usually the precise number of pages that were _newly    
deleted_ during the specific VACUUM operation that last set the field).    
    
The general idea behind storing btm_last_cleanup_num_delpages is to use    
it to give _some_ consideration to non-recycled deleted pages inside    
_bt_vacuum_needs_cleanup() -- though never too much.  We only really    
need to avoid leaving a truly excessive number of deleted pages in an    
unrecycled state forever.  We only do this to cover certain narrow cases    
where no other factor makes VACUUM do a full scan, and yet the index    
continues to grow (and so actually misses out on recycling existing    
deleted pages).    
    
These metapage changes result in a clear user-visible benefit: We no    
longer trigger full index scans during VACUUM operations solely due to    
the presence of only 1 or 2 known deleted (though unrecycled) blocks    
from a very large index.  All that matters now is keeping the costs and    
benefits in balance over time.    
    
Fix an issue that has been around since commit 857f9c36, which added the    
"skip full scan of index" mechanism (i.e. the _bt_vacuum_needs_cleanup()    
logic).  The accuracy of btm_last_cleanup_num_heap_tuples accidentally    
hinged upon _when_ the source value gets stored.  We now always store    
btm_last_cleanup_num_heap_tuples in btvacuumcleanup().  This fixes the    
issue because IndexVacuumInfo.num_heap_tuples (the source field) is    
expected to accurately indicate the state of the table _after_ the    
VACUUM completes inside btvacuumcleanup().    
    
A backpatchable fix cannot easily be extracted from this commit.  A    
targeted fix for the issue will follow in a later commit, though that    
won't happen today.    
    
I (pgeoghegan) have chosen to remove any mention of deleted pages in the    
documentation of the vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor GUC/param, since    
the presence of deleted (though unrecycled) pages is no longer of much    
concern to users.  The vacuum_cleanup_index_scale_factor description in    
the docs now seems rather unclear in any case, and it should probably be    
rewritten in the near future.  Perhaps some passing mention of page    
deletion will be added back at the same time.    
    
Bump XLOG_PAGE_MAGIC due to nbtree WAL records using full XIDs now.
