## 背景  
PG逻辑订阅功能, 当初始同步表时, 采用单个事务完成表原始的数据 以及 同步表的原始数据过程中产生的增量事务.   
  
如果原始表的记录数特别多, 初始数据同步时间比较长, 在这个过程中可能产生了很多新事务, 会带来一系列问题:  
  
- (a) We have to perform the entire copy operation again if there is any error (network breakdown, error in the database operation, etc.) while we synchronize the WAL position between tablesync worker and apply worker; this will be onerous especially for large copies,   
- (b) Using a single transaction in the synchronization-phase (where we can receive WAL from multiple transactions) will have the risk of exceeding the CID limit,   
- (c) The slot will hold the WAL till the entire sync is complete because we never commit till the end.

Allow multiple xacts during table sync in logical replication.  
  
For the initial table data synchronization in logical replication, we use  
a single transaction to copy the entire table and then synchronize the  
position in the stream with the main apply worker.  
  
There are multiple downsides of this approach: (a) We have to perform the  
entire copy operation again if there is any error (network breakdown,  
error in the database operation, etc.) while we synchronize the WAL  
position between tablesync worker and apply worker; this will be onerous  
especially for large copies, (b) Using a single transaction in the  
synchronization-phase (where we can receive WAL from multiple  
transactions) will have the risk of exceeding the CID limit, (c) The slot  
will hold the WAL till the entire sync is complete because we never commit  
till the end.  
  
This patch solves all the above downsides by allowing multiple  
transactions during the tablesync phase. The initial copy is done in a  
single transaction and after that, we commit each transaction as we  
receive. To allow recovery after any error or crash, we use a permanent  
slot and origin to track the progress. The slot and origin will be removed  
once we finish the synchronization of the table. We also remove slot and  
origin of tablesync workers if the user performs DROP SUBSCRIPTION .. or  
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION .. REFERESH and some of the table syncs are still not  
finished.  
  
The commands ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION and  
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... SET PUBLICATION ... with refresh option as true  
cannot be executed inside a transaction block because they can now drop  
the slots for which we have no provision to rollback.  
  
This will also open up the path for logical replication of 2PC  
transactions on the subscriber side. Previously, we can't do that because  
of the requirement of maintaining a single transaction in tablesync  
workers.  
  
Bump catalog version due to change of state in the catalog  
(pg_subscription_rel).
