之前不支持parallel full outer join的原因是有死锁风险, 16增加了PHJ phase PHJ_BATCH_SCAN处理死锁问题.

Parallel Hash Full Join.  
  
Full and right outer joins were not supported in the initial  
implementation of Parallel Hash Join because of deadlock hazards (see  
discussion).  Therefore FULL JOIN inhibited parallelism, as the other  
join strategies can't do that in parallel either.  
  
Add a new PHJ phase PHJ_BATCH_SCAN that scans for unmatched tuples on  
the inner side of one batch's hash table.  For now, sidestep the  
deadlock problem by terminating parallelism there.  The last process to  
arrive at that phase emits the unmatched tuples, while others detach and  
are free to go and work on other batches, if there are any, but  
otherwise they finish the join early.  
  
That unfairness is considered acceptable for now, because it's better  
than no parallelism at all.  The build and probe phases are run in  
parallel, and the new scan-for-unmatched phase, while serial, is usually  
applied to the smaller of the two relations and is either limited by  
some multiple of work_mem, or it's too big and is partitioned into  
batches and then the situation is improved by batch-level parallelism.
