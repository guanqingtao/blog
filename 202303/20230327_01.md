Make SCRAM iteration count configurable  
  
Replace the hardcoded value with a GUC such that the iteration  
count can be raised in order to increase protection against  
brute-force attacks.  The hardcoded value for SCRAM iteration  
count was defined to be 4096, which is taken from RFC 7677, so  
set the default for the GUC to 4096 to match.  In RFC 7677 the  
recommendation is at least 15000 iterations but 4096 is listed  
as a SHOULD requirement given that it's estimated to yield a  
0.5s processing time on a mobile handset of the time of RFC  
writing (late 2015).  
  
Raising the iteration count of SCRAM will make stored passwords  
more resilient to brute-force attacks at a higher computational  
cost during connection establishment.  Lowering the count will  
reduce computational overhead during connections at the tradeoff  
of reducing strength against brute-force attacks.  
  
There are however platforms where even a modest iteration count  
yields a too high computational overhead, with weaker password  
encryption schemes chosen as a result.  In these situations,  
SCRAM with a very low iteration count still gives benefits over  
weaker schemes like md5, so we allow the iteration count to be  
set to one at the low end.  
  
The new GUC is intentionally generically named such that it can  
be made to support future SCRAM standards should they emerge.  
At that point the value can be made into key:value pairs with  
an undefined key as a default which will be backwards compatible  
with this.
