## 背景    
重点升级了IO统计的颗粒度, 从新的统计信息可以有助于判断如何优化shared buffer, checkpoint 调度, bgwriter 调度, backend 刷盘等相关的参数. 从而减少backend刷盘带来的IO延迟, 减少IO操作提升性能等.   
  
可以给如下相关参数以更好的调整指导:  
```  
shared_buffers  
temp_buffers  
work_mem  
hash_mem_multiplier  
maintenance_work_mem  
autovacuum_work_mem  
logical_decoding_work_mem  
#bgwriter_delay = 200ms                 # 10-10000ms between rounds  
#bgwriter_lru_maxpages = 100            # max buffers written/round, 0 disables  
#bgwriter_lru_multiplier = 2.0          # 0-10.0 multiplier on buffers scanned/round  
#bgwriter_flush_after = 0               # measured in pages, 0 disables  
  
# - Asynchronous Behavior -  
  
#backend_flush_after = 0                # measured in pages, 0 disables  
  
#wal_buffers = -1                       # min 32kB, -1 sets based on shared_buffers  
                                        # (change requires restart)  
wal_writer_delay = 10ms         # 1-10000 milliseconds  
#wal_writer_flush_after = 1MB           # measured in pages, 0 disables  
#wal_skip_threshold = 2MB  
# - Checkpoints -  
  
#checkpoint_timeout = 5min              # range 30s-1d  
#checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9     # checkpoint target duration, 0.0 - 1.0  
#checkpoint_flush_after = 0             # measured in pages, 0 disables  
```  
  
重点看这个:   
  
The new IO statistics count :   
- IO operations (evict, extend, fsync, read, reuse, and write),   
- and are aggregated for each combination of backend type (backend, autovacuum worker, bgwriter, etc),   
- target object of the IO (relations, temp relations)   
- and context of the IO (normal, vacuum, bulkread, bulkwrite).  
  
原来的版本统计颗粒度太大, 对优化参数参考价值不大.

pgstat: Infrastructure for more detailed IO statistics  
  
This commit adds the infrastructure for more detailed IO statistics. The calls  
to actually count IOs, a system view to access the new statistics,  
documentation and tests will be added in subsequent commits, to make review  
easier.  
  
While we already had some IO statistics, e.g. in pg_stat_bgwriter and  
pg_stat_database, they did not provide sufficient detail to understand what  
the main sources of IO are, or whether configuration changes could avoid  
IO. E.g., pg_stat_bgwriter.buffers_backend does contain the number of buffers  
written out by a backend, but as that includes extending relations (always  
done by backends) and writes triggered by the use of buffer access strategies,  
it cannot easily be used to tune background writer or checkpointer. Similarly,  
pg_stat_database.blks_read cannot easily be used to tune shared_buffers /  
compute a cache hit ratio, as the use of buffer access strategies will often  
prevent a large fraction of the read blocks to end up in shared_buffers.  
  
The new IO statistics count IO operations (evict, extend, fsync, read, reuse,  
and write), and are aggregated for each combination of backend type (backend,  
autovacuum worker, bgwriter, etc), target object of the IO (relations, temp  
relations) and context of the IO (normal, vacuum, bulkread, bulkwrite).  
  
What is tracked in this series of patches, is sufficient to perform the  
aforementioned analyses. Further details, e.g. tracking the number of buffer  
hits, would make that even easier, but was left out for now, to keep the scope  
of the already large patchset manageable.
