This is the first part of a two-part tutorial session, morning and afternoon.  
  
* This tutorial is focused on teaching PostgreSQL to professionals who are already experienced with Oracle or MySQL. As we discuss from the basics, even a beginner may adapt the concepts easily. Relational databases share a lot of similar concepts. You may find it easier if we help you relate the concepts of PostgreSQL with Oracle/MySQL. Thus, we will start with PostgreSQL Architecture for Oracle/MySQL DBAs.  
  
* The approach we take with this tutorial is to present an overview of the PostgreSQL architecture and operation in view of MySQL's and Oracle's. We'll mix lecture with hands-on work, having the audience apply the concepts we present in practice in a lab format before covering new ones, starting with a simple and quick installation of PostgreSQL and going all the way to set up and maintain a stand by replica. By the end of the day, attendees shall walk away with a good understanding of how PostgreSQL works, and feel confident enough to try it themselves.  
  
Here are the main points covered in this tutorial :  
  
* Brief history of PostgreSQL and its features  
* PostgreSQL Architecture for MySQL/Oracle DBAs and beginners.  
* Installation of PostgreSQL  
* Create/Start/Stop a PostgreSQL Cluster and the components of a Data Directory  
* PostgreSQL parameters/settings you need to know  
* PostgreSQL User Management  
* MVCC in PostgreSQL  
* VACUUM and Transaction ID Wraparound in PostgreSQL  
* Types of Indexes  
* EXPLAIN in PostgreSQL  
* Logical and Physical Backups and PITR  
* Streaming replication  
* Failover  
* Declarative Partitioning in PostgreSQL 10 and furthermore features in PostgreSQL 11.
