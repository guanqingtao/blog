## 背景      
PostgreSQL 16 preview - Add io_direct setting (developer-only) - 终于想好好搞shared buffer管理了?    
  
目前PG 的wal允许io_direct, 也就是不经过OS kernel page cache, 没有2次内存使用的情况. 仅仅当下游有standby时不使用wal io_direct, 由于wal会被马上读取出来, 所以有page cache可能对读wal的性能更好.  
  
而pg 目前是不支持data file的io_direct的, 衍生品 PolarDB-PG 支持, 因为它采用共享存储架构, 不允许有page cache, 以跨节点防脏读.    
  
PostgreSQL 16 提供了1个配置参数来控制启用io_direct的范围: wal, data, wal_init.  逗号隔开可以配置多个组合.    
- data for main data files,   
- wal for WAL files,   
- and wal_init for WAL files when being initially allocated.

Add io_direct setting (developer-only).  
  
Provide a way to ask the kernel to use O_DIRECT (or local equivalent)  
where available for data and WAL files, to avoid or minimize kernel  
caching.  This hurts performance currently and is not intended for end  
users yet.  Later proposed work would introduce our own I/O clustering,  
read-ahead, etc to replace the facilities the kernel disables with this  
option.  
  
The only user-visible change, if the developer-only GUC is not used, is  
that this commit also removes the obscure logic that would activate  
O_DIRECT for the WAL when wal_sync_method=open_[data]sync and  
wal_level=minimal (which also requires max_wal_senders=0).  Those are  
non-default and unlikely settings, and this behavior wasn't (correctly)  
documented.  The same effect can be achieved with io_direct=wal.

Introduce PG_IO_ALIGN_SIZE and align all I/O buffers.

In order to have the option to use O_DIRECT/FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING in a
later commit, we need the addresses of user space buffers to be well
aligned.  The exact requirements vary by OS and file system (typically
sectors and/or memory pages).  The address alignment size is set to
4096, which is enough for currently known systems: it matches modern
sectors and common memory page size.  There is no standard governing
O_DIRECT's requirements so we might eventually have to reconsider this
with more information from the field or future systems.

Aligning I/O buffers on memory pages is also known to improve regular
buffered I/O performance.

Three classes of I/O buffers for regular data pages are adjusted:
(1) Heap buffers are now allocated with the new palloc_aligned() or
MemoryContextAllocAligned() functions introduced by commit 439f6175.
(2) Stack buffers now use a new struct PGIOAlignedBlock to respect
PG_IO_ALIGN_SIZE, if possible with this compiler.  (3) The buffer
pool is also aligned in shared memory.

WAL buffers were already aligned on XLOG_BLCKSZ.  It's possible for
XLOG_BLCKSZ to be configured smaller than PG_IO_ALIGNED_SIZE and thus
for O_DIRECT WAL writes to fail to be well aligned, but that's a
pre-existing condition and will be addressed by a later commit.

BufFiles are not yet addressed (there's no current plan to use O_DIRECT
for those, but they could potentially get some incidental speedup even
in plain buffered I/O operations through better alignment).

If we can't align stack objects suitably using the compiler extensions
we know about, we disable the use of O_DIRECT by setting PG_O_DIRECT to
0.  This avoids the need to consider systems that have O_DIRECT but
can't align stack objects the way we want; such systems could in theory
be supported with more work but we don't currently know of any such
machines, so it's easier to pretend there is no O_DIRECT support
instead.  That's an existing and tested class of system.

Add assertions that all buffers passed into smgrread(), smgrwrite() and
smgrextend() are correctly aligned, unless PG_O_DIRECT is 0 (= stack
alignment tricks may be unavailable) or the block size has been set too
small to allow arrays of buffers to be all aligned.
