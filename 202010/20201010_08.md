## 背景    
主要影响: core team成员, EDB超过半数, 可以操控社区. 社区正在解决. - First, there is an unwritten rule that the Postgres core team should not have over half of its members from a single company, and the acquisition causes EDB's representation in the core team to be 60% — the core team is working on a solution for this.    
  
有可能会扩充成员, 或对现有成员进行替换.

Community Impact of 2nd Quadrant Purchase    
Posted by Bruce Momjian in EDB on 2020-10-07 at 16:30    
Last week 2nd Quadrant was purchased by EDB. While this is certainly good news for these companies, it can increase risks to the Postgres community. First, there is an unwritten rule that the Postgres core team should not have over half of its members from a single company, and the acquisition causes EDB's representation in the core team to be 60% — the core team is working on a solution for this.    
    
Second, two companies becoming one reduces Postgres user choice for support and services, especially in the North American and western European markets. Reduced vendor options often results in a worse customer service and less innovation. Since the Postgres community does independent innovation, this might not be an issue for community software, but could be for company-controlled tooling around Postgres.    
    
Third, there is the risk that an even larger company wanting to hurt Postgres could acquire EDB and take it in a direction that is neutral or negative for the Postgres community. Employee non-compete agreements, and the lack of other Postgres support companies could extend the duration of these effects. There isn't much the community can do to minimize these issues but to be alert for problems.
