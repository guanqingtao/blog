以前的版本, 在standby启动时, 必须等replay当前wal目录中的所有wal文件(startup process)结束后, 才会启动wal receiver进程接收上游wal 数据, 如果startup花费了很长时间, 上游的wal可能会被rotate(在没有使用slot或者wal keep segments较小时).     
    
PG 14解决了这个问题, 无需等待startup process replay所有wal目录中的wal文件.

Hi    
    
Standby does not start walreceiver process until startup process    
finishes WAL replay.  The more WAL there is to replay, longer is the    
delay in starting streaming replication.  If replication connection is    
temporarily disconnected, this delay becomes a major problem and we    
are proposing a solution to avoid the delay.    
    
WAL replay is likely to fall behind when master is processing    
write-heavy workload, because WAL is generated by concurrently running    
backends on master while only one startup process on standby replays WAL    
records in sequence as new WAL is received from master.    
    
Replication connection between walsender and walreceiver may break due    
to reasons such as transient network issue, standby going through    
restart, etc.  The delay in resuming replication connection leads to    
lack of high availability - only one copy of WAL is available during    
this period.    
    
The problem worsens when the replication is configured to be    
synchronous.  Commits on master must wait until the WAL replay is    
finished on standby, walreceiver is then started and it confirms flush    
of WAL upto the commit LSN.  If synchronous_commit GUC is set to    
remote_write, this behavior is equivalent to tacitly changing it to    
remote_apply until the replication connection is re-established!    
    
Has anyone encountered such a problem with streaming replication?    
    
We propose to address this by starting walreceiver without waiting for    
startup process to finish replay of WAL.  Please see attached    
patchset.  It can be summarized as follows:    
    
    0001 - TAP test to demonstrate the problem.    
    0002 - The standby startup sequence is changed such that    
           walreceiver is started by startup process before it begins    
           to replay WAL.    
    0003 - Postmaster starts walreceiver if it finds that a    
           walreceiver process is no longer running and the state    
           indicates that it is operating as a standby.    
    
This is a POC, we are looking for early feedback on whether the    
problem is worth solving and if it makes sense to solve if along this    
route.
