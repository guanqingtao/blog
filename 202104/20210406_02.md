## 背景      
vacuum 过程中, tuple,item等状态跟踪代码重构, 简化state管理.   
  
Reorganize the state struct used by VACUUM -- group related items  
together to make it easier to understand.  Also stop relying on stack  
variables inside lazy_scan_heap() -- move those into the state struct  
instead.  Doing things this way simplifies large groups of related  
functions whose function signatures had a lot of unnecessary redundancy.

Simplify state managed by VACUUM.  
  
Reorganize the state struct used by VACUUM -- group related items  
together to make it easier to understand.  Also stop relying on stack  
variables inside lazy_scan_heap() -- move those into the state struct  
instead.  Doing things this way simplifies large groups of related  
functions whose function signatures had a lot of unnecessary redundancy.  
  
Switch over to using int64 for the struct fields used to count things  
that are reported to the user via log_autovacuum and VACUUM VERBOSE  
output.  We were using double, but that doesn't seem to have any  
advantages.  Using int64 makes it possible to add assertions that verify  
that the first pass over the heap (pruning) encounters precisely the  
same number of LP_DEAD items that get deleted from indexes later on, in  
the second pass over the heap.  These assertions will be added in later  
commits.  
  
Finally, adjust the signatures of functions with IndexBulkDeleteResult  
pointer arguments in cases where there was ambiguity about whether or  
not the argument relates to a single index or all indexes.  Functions  
now use the idiom that both ambulkdelete() and amvacuumcleanup() have  
always used (where appropriate): accept a mutable IndexBulkDeleteResult  
pointer argument, and return a result IndexBulkDeleteResult pointer to  
caller.
