## 背景      
PostgreSQL 14 preview - 支持循环WAL decoding buffer , 优化逻辑decoding性能   
  
buffer大小参数 : wal_decode_buffer_size , 未来支持使用shared memory管理. 大于buffer的recoder使用palloc()开辟其他内存区域存储.    
  
```

Add circular WAL decoding buffer.  
  
Teach xlogreader.c to decode its output into a circular buffer, to  
support optimizations based on looking ahead.  
  
 * XLogReadRecord() works as before, consuming records one by one, and  
   allowing them to be examined via the traditional XLogRecGetXXX()  
   macros.  
  
 * An alternative new interface XLogNextRecord() is added that returns  
   pointers to DecodedXLogRecord structs that can be examined directly.  
  
 * XLogReadAhead() provides a second cursor that lets you see  
   further ahead, as long as data is available and there is enough space  
   in the decoding buffer.  This returns DecodedXLogRecord pointers to the  
   caller, but also adds them to a queue of records that will later be  
   consumed by XLogNextRecord()/XLogReadRecord().  
  
The buffer's size is controlled with wal_decode_buffer_size.  The buffer  
could potentially be placed into shared memory, for future projects.  
Large records that don't fit in the circular buffer are called  
"oversized" and allocated separately with palloc().
