1、减少传导不必要的列value    
  
```  
-         Output: $1, $2, t.c, (SubPlan 1 (returns $1,$2)), t.ctid  
+         Output: $1, $2, (SubPlan 1 (returns $1,$2)), t.ctid  
          One-Time Filter: (CURRENT_USER = SESSION_USER)  
          ->  Seq Scan on public.update_test t  
  
  
-               Output: t.c, t.a, t.ctid  
+               Output: t.a, t.ctid  
```  
  
2、避免为每个分区生成subplan     
  
```  
-   ->  Nested Loop (actual rows=0 loops=1)  
-         ->  Append (actual rows=1 loops=1)  
-               ->  Bitmap Heap Scan on ab_a1_b1 ab_1 (actual rows=0 loops=1)  
-                     Recheck Cond: (a = 1)  
-                     ->  Bitmap Index Scan on ab_a1_b1_a_idx (actual rows=0 loops=1)  
-                           Index Cond: (a = 1)  
-               ->  Bitmap Heap Scan on ab_a1_b2 ab_2 (actual rows=1 loops=1)  
-                     Recheck Cond: (a = 1)  
-                     Heap Blocks: exact=1  
-                     ->  Bitmap Index Scan on ab_a1_b2_a_idx (actual rows=1 loops=1)  
-                           Index Cond: (a = 1)  
-               ->  Bitmap Heap Scan on ab_a1_b3 ab_3 (actual rows=0 loops=1)  
-                     Recheck Cond: (a = 1)  
-                     ->  Bitmap Index Scan on ab_a1_b3_a_idx (actual rows=0 loops=1)  
-                           Index Cond: (a = 1)  
-         ->  Materialize (actual rows=0 loops=1)  
-               ->  Bitmap Heap Scan on ab_a1_b1 ab_a1_1 (actual rows=0 loops=1)  
-                     Recheck Cond: (a = 1)  
-                     ->  Bitmap Index Scan on ab_a1_b1_a_idx (actual rows=0 loops=1)  
-                           Index Cond: (a = 1)  
    ->  Nested Loop (actual rows=1 loops=1)  
          ->  Append (actual rows=1 loops=1)  
-               ->  Bitmap Heap Scan on ab_a1_b1 ab_1 (actual rows=0 loops=1)  
  
  
  
+               ->  Bitmap Heap Scan on ab_a1_b1 ab_a1_1 (actual rows=0 loops=1)

Rework planning and execution of UPDATE and DELETE.  
  
This patch makes two closely related sets of changes:  
  
1. For UPDATE, the subplan of the ModifyTable node now only delivers  
the new values of the changed columns (i.e., the expressions computed  
in the query's SET clause) plus row identity information such as CTID.  
ModifyTable must re-fetch the original tuple to merge in the old  
values of any unchanged columns.  The core advantage of this is that  
the changed columns are uniform across all tables of an inherited or  
partitioned target relation, whereas the other columns might not be.  
A secondary advantage, when the UPDATE involves joins, is that less  
data needs to pass through the plan tree.  The disadvantage of course  
is an extra fetch of each tuple to be updated.  However, that seems to  
be very nearly free in context; even worst-case tests don't show it to  
add more than a couple percent to the total query cost.  At some point  
it might be interesting to combine the re-fetch with the tuple access  
that ModifyTable must do anyway to mark the old tuple dead; but that  
would require a good deal of refactoring and it seems it wouldn't buy  
all that much, so this patch doesn't attempt it.  
  
2. For inherited UPDATE/DELETE, instead of generating a separate  
subplan for each target relation, we now generate a single subplan  
that is just exactly like a SELECT's plan, then stick ModifyTable  
on top of that.  To let ModifyTable know which target relation a  
given incoming row refers to, a tableoid junk column is added to  
the row identity information.  This gets rid of the horrid hack  
that was inheritance_planner(), eliminating O(N^2) planning cost  
and memory consumption in cases where there were many unprunable  
target relations.  
  
Point 2 of course requires point 1, so that there is a uniform  
definition of the non-junk columns to be returned by the subplan.  
We can't insist on uniform definition of the row identity junk  
columns however, if we want to keep the ability to have both  
plain and foreign tables in a partitioning hierarchy.  Since  
it wouldn't scale very far to have every child table have its  
own row identity column, this patch includes provisions to merge  
similar row identity columns into one column of the subplan result.  
In particular, we can merge the whole-row Vars typically used as  
row identity by FDWs into one column by pretending they are type  
RECORD.  (It's still okay for the actual composite Datums to be  
labeled with the table's rowtype OID, though.)  
  
There is more that can be done to file down residual inefficiencies  
in this patch, but it seems to be committable now.  
  
FDW authors should note several API changes:  
  
* The argument list for AddForeignUpdateTargets() has changed, and so  
has the method it must use for adding junk columns to the query.  Call  
add_row_identity_var() instead of manipulating the parse tree directly.  
You might want to reconsider exactly what you're adding, too.  
  
* PlanDirectModify() must now work a little harder to find the  
ForeignScan plan node; if the foreign table is part of a partitioning  
hierarchy then the ForeignScan might not be the direct child of  
ModifyTable.  See postgres_fdw for sample code.  
  
* To check whether a relation is a target relation, it's no  
longer sufficient to compare its relid to root->parse->resultRelation.  
Instead, check it against all_result_relids or leaf_result_relids,  
as appropriate.
