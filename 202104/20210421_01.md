几个关键知识点  
  
1、buffer管理的三层结构  
- 1、buffer table: 要访问的数据 page tag(文件ID,block number,fork number), 以及它对应的buffer_id(类似array的下标, 用于buffer descriptors, buffer pool的寻址)    
    - buffer table 的slot数可能比buffer_ids 数少, 而且有hash冲突存在, 所以一个buffer table slot内可能存储多个tag    
    - 如果要修改buffer table slot内的内容, 需要加bufmappinglock exclusive lock, 注意这个是锁整个buffer table, 为了提高吞吐, PG 把buffer table分成了几个partition, 修改一个buffer table slot时, 锁这个slot对应的partition(也就是说, 同一个partition内的slot只能串行修改, 但是也大幅度减少了修改buffer table 的冲突)    
- 2、buffer descriptors, buffer_id、对应buffer的状态  
    - shared buffer中的每个block对应一个buffer_id, ID用于寻址  
    - 对应buffer page的状态  
        - tag holds the buffer_tag of the stored page in the corresponding buffer pool slot (buffer tag is defined in Section 8.1.2).  
        - buffer_id identifies the descriptor (equivalent to the buffer_id of the corresponding buffer pool slot).  
        - refcount holds the number of PostgreSQL processes currently accessing the associated stored page. It is also referred to as pin count. When a PostgreSQL process accesses the stored page, its refcount must be incremented by 1 (refcount++). After accessing the page, its refcount must be decreased by 1 (refcount--). When the refcount is zero, i.e. the associated stored page is not currently being accessed, the page is unpinned; otherwise it is pinned.  
        - usage_count holds the number of times the associated stored page has been accessed since it was loaded into the corresponding buffer pool slot. Note that usage_count is used in the page replacement algorithm (Section 8.4.4).  
        - context_lock and io_in_progress_lock are light-weight locks that are used to control access to the associated stored page. These fields are described in Section 8.3.2.  
        - flags can hold several states of the associated stored page. The main states are as follows:  
            - dirty bit indicates whether the stored page is dirty.  
            - valid bit indicates whether the stored page can be read or written (valid). For example, if this bit is valid, then the corresponding buffer pool slot stores a page and this descriptor (valid bit) holds the page metadata; thus, the stored page can be read or written. If this bit is invalid, then this descriptor does not hold any metadata; this means that the stored page cannot be read or written or the buffer manager is replacing the stored page.  
            - io_in_progress bit indicates whether the buffer manager is reading/writing the associated page from/to storage. In other words, this bit indicates whether a single process holds the io_in_progress_lock of this descriptor.  
        - freeNext is a pointer to the next descriptor to generate a freelist, which is described in the next subsection.  
        - Buffer ID 描述符的几种状态  
            - Empty: When the corresponding buffer pool slot does not store a page (i.e. refcount and usage_count are 0), the state of this descriptor is empty.  
            - Pinned: When the corresponding buffer pool slot stores a page and any PostgreSQL processes are accessing the page (i.e. refcount and usage_count are greater than or equal to 1), the state of this buffer descriptor is pinned.  
            - Unpinned: When the corresponding buffer pool slot stores a page but no PostgreSQL processes are accessing the page (i.e. usage_count is greater than or equal to 1, but refcount is 0), the state of this buffer descriptor is unpinned.  
- 3、buffer pool  
    - 存储数据文件的内容     
  
2、Page Replacement Algorithm: Clock Sweep   
buffer pool page老化机制:   
循环遍历buffer descriptors, 遇到unpined的buffer id就减少usage_count, 直到找到usage_count=0的buffer id, 然后释放对应的buffer pool page.    
  
3、为什么大表查询或大量数据导入不会影响shared buffer热数据  
ring buffer  
- Bulk-reading  
    - When a relation whose size exceeds one-quarter of the buffer pool size (shared_buffers/4) is scanned. In this case, the ring buffer size is 256 KB.  
- Bulk-writing  
    - When the SQL commands listed below are executed. In this case, the ring buffer size is 16 MB.  
    - COPY FROM command.  
    - CREATE TABLE AS command.  
    - CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW or REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW command.  
    - ALTER TABLE command.  
- Vacuum-processing  
    - When an autovacuum performs a vacuum processing. In this case, the ring buffer size is 256 KB.
