## 背景        
  
当表的年龄(pg_class. relfrozenxid  relminmxid ) 超过 vacuum_failsafe_age,  vacuum_multixact_failsafe_age. 这两个参数默认为16亿.     
  
这个表的vacuum会被强制加速, 忽略delay参数, 同时跳过不必要的垃圾回收(例如index的vacuum会被跳过), 从而彻底防止xid wraparound .    
  
PG 14以前, 虽然有手段, 但是vacuum依旧收到delay参数的控制, vacuum时会休息, 另外表的index vacuum也会增加vacuum的时间.  
  
PG 14的vacuum加速针对的是紧急情况, 即防止xid wraparound.

Add wraparound failsafe to VACUUM.  
  
Add a failsafe mechanism that is triggered by VACUUM when it notices  
that the table's relfrozenxid and/or relminmxid are dangerously far in  
the past.  VACUUM checks the age of the table dynamically, at regular  
intervals.  
  
When the failsafe triggers, VACUUM takes extraordinary measures to  
finish as quickly as possible so that relfrozenxid and/or relminmxid can  
be advanced.  VACUUM will stop applying any cost-based delay that may be  
in effect.  VACUUM will also bypass any further index vacuuming and heap  
vacuuming -- it only completes whatever remaining pruning and freezing  
is required.  Bypassing index/heap vacuuming is enabled by commit  
8523492d, which made it possible to dynamically trigger the mechanism  
already used within VACUUM when it is run with INDEX_CLEANUP off.  
  
It is expected that the failsafe will almost always trigger within an  
autovacuum to prevent wraparound, long after the autovacuum began.  
However, the failsafe mechanism can trigger in any VACUUM operation.  
Even in a non-aggressive VACUUM, where we're likely to not advance  
relfrozenxid, it still seems like a good idea to finish off remaining  
pruning and freezing.   An aggressive/anti-wraparound VACUUM will be  
launched immediately afterwards.  Note that the anti-wraparound VACUUM  
that follows will itself trigger the failsafe, usually before it even  
begins its first (and only) pass over the heap.  
  
The failsafe is controlled by two new GUCs: vacuum_failsafe_age, and  
vacuum_multixact_failsafe_age.  There are no equivalent reloptions,  
since that isn't expected to be useful.  The GUCs have rather high  
defaults (both default to 1.6 billion), and are expected to generally  
only be used to make the failsafe trigger sooner/more frequently.
