## 背景    
ExecInitModifyTable 分区裁剪精细化, 不需要touch不必要的分区.

Postpone some stuff out of ExecInitModifyTable.  
  
Arrange to do some things on-demand, rather than immediately during  
executor startup, because there's a fair chance of never having to do  
them at all:  
  
* Don't open result relations' indexes until needed.  
  
* Don't initialize partition tuple routing, nor the child-to-root  
tuple conversion map, until needed.  
  
This wins in UPDATEs on partitioned tables when only some of the  
partitions will actually receive updates; with larger partition  
counts the savings is quite noticeable.  Also, we can remove some  
sketchy heuristics in ExecInitModifyTable about whether to set up  
tuple routing.  
  
Also, remove execPartition.c's private hash table tracking which  
partitions were already opened by the ModifyTable node.  Instead  
use the hash added to ModifyTable itself by commit 86dc90056.  
  
To allow lazy computation of the conversion maps, we now set  
ri_RootResultRelInfo in all child ResultRelInfos.  We formerly set it  
only in some, not terribly well-defined, cases.  This has user-visible  
side effects in that now more error messages refer to the root  
relation instead of some partition (and provide error data in the  
root's column order, too).  It looks to me like this is a strict  
improvement in consistency, so I don't have a problem with the  
output changes visible in this commit.  
  
Extracted from a larger patch, which seemed to me to be too messy  
to push in one commit.

Postpone some more stuff out of ExecInitModifyTable.  
  
Delay creation of the projections for INSERT and UPDATE tuples  
until they're needed.  This saves a pretty fair amount of work  
when only some of the partitions are actually touched.  
  
The logic associated with identifying junk columns in UPDATE/DELETE  
is moved to another loop, allowing removal of one loop over the  
target relations; but it didn't actually change at all.
