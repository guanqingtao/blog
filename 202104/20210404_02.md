## 背景    
wait event 移除对MyProc的依赖, 使用共享内存 管理 等待事件变量 , 未来更多统计信息相关内容将通过共享内存管理     
  
The main motivator to commit this work now is that removing the (indirect)  
pgproc.h include from pgstat.h simplifies a patch to move statistics reporting  
to shared memory (which still has a chance to get into 14).

Improve efficiency of wait event reporting, remove proc.h dependency.  
  
pgstat_report_wait_start() and pgstat_report_wait_end() required two  
conditional branches so far. One to check if MyProc is NULL, the other to  
check if pgstat_track_activities is set. As wait events are used around  
comparatively lightweight operations, and are inlined (reducing branch  
predictor effectiveness), that's not great.  
  
The dependency on MyProc has a second disadvantage: Low-level subsystems, like  
storage/file/fd.c, report wait events, but architecturally it is preferable  
for them to not depend on inter-process subsystems like proc.h (defining  
PGPROC).  After this change including pgstat.h (nor obviously its  
sub-components like backend_status.h, wait_event.h, ...) does not pull in IPC  
related headers anymore.  
  
These goals, efficiency and abstraction, are achieved by having  
pgstat_report_wait_start/end() not interact with MyProc, but instead a new  
my_wait_event_info variable. At backend startup it points to a local variable,  
removing the need to check for MyProc being NULL. During process  
initialization my_wait_event_info is redirected to MyProc->wait_event_info. At  
shutdown this is reversed. Because wait event reporting now does not need to  
know about where the wait event is stored, it does not need to know about  
PGPROC anymore.  
  
The removal of the branch for checking pgstat_track_activities is simpler:  
Don't check anymore. The cost due to the branch are often higher than the  
store - and even if not, pgstat_track_activities is rarely disabled.  
  
The main motivator to commit this work now is that removing the (indirect)  
pgproc.h include from pgstat.h simplifies a patch to move statistics reporting  
to shared memory (which still has a chance to get into 14).
