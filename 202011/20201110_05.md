## 背景      
Hybrid Hash/Nested Loop joins and caching results from subplans    
    
解决    
    
```    
out a  (与B关联的value大量重复) 例如1-100的value有100000条    
  inner b (小表) 例如包含的数据范围是1-100, 循环  100000 次      
```    
    
导致b循环次数过多的情况.     
    
cache result相比 b index scan还是快很多.

```    
Hackers,    
    
    
    
Over on [1], Heikki mentioned about the usefulness of caching results    
from parameterized subplans so that they could be used again for    
subsequent scans which have the same parameters as a previous scan.    
On [2], I mentioned that parameterized nested loop joins could see    
similar gains with such a cache. I suggested there that instead of    
adding code that only allows this to work for subplans, that instead,    
we add a new node type that can handle the caching for us.  We can    
then just inject that node type in places where it seems beneficial.    
    
    
    
I've attached a patch which implements this.  The new node type is    
called "Result Cache".  I'm not particularly wedded to keeping that    
name, but if I change it, I only want to do it once. I've got a few    
other names I mind, but I don't feel strongly or confident enough in    
them to go and do the renaming.    
    
    
    
How the caching works:    
    
    
    
First off, it's only good for plugging in on top of parameterized    
nodes that are rescanned with different parameters. The cache itself    
uses a hash table using the simplehash.h implementation.  The memory    
consumption is limited to work_mem. The code maintains an LRU list and    
when we need to add new entries but don't have enough space to do so,    
we free off older items starting at the top of the LRU list.  When we    
get a cache hit, we move that entry to the end of the LRU list so that    
it'll be the last to be evicted.    
    
    
    
When should we cache:    
    
    
    
For nested loop joins, the decision is made purely based on cost.  The    
costing model looks at the expected number of calls, the distinct    
value estimate and work_mem size. It then determines how many items    
can be cached and then goes on to estimate an expected cache hit ratio    
and also an eviction ratio. It adjusts the input costs according to    
those ratios and adds some additional charges for caching and cache    
lookups.    
    
    
    
For subplans, since we plan subplans before we're done planning the    
outer plan, there's very little information to go on about the number    
of times that the cache will be looked up. For now, I've coded things    
so the cache is always used for EXPR_SUBLINK type subplans.  There may    
be other types of subplan that could support caching too, but I've not    
really gone through them all yet to determine which.  I certainly know    
there's some that we can't cache for.    
    
    
    
Why caching might be good:    
    
    
    
With hash joins, it's sometimes not so great that we have to hash the    
entire inner plan and only probe a very small number of values.  If we    
were able to only fill the hash table with values that are needed,    
then then a lot of time and memory could be saved.  Effectively, the    
patch does exactly this with the combination of a parameterized nested    
loop join with a Result Cache node above the inner scan.    
    
    
    
For subplans, the gains can be more because often subplans are much    
more expensive to execute than what might go on the inside of a    
parameterized nested loop join.    
    
    
    
Current problems and some ways to make it better:    
    
    
    
The patch does rely heavily on good ndistinct estimates. One    
unfortunate problem is that if the planner has no statistics for    
whatever it's trying to estimate for, it'll default to returning    
DEFAULT_NUM_DISTINCT (200).  That may cause the Result Cache to appear    
much more favourable than it should.  One way I can think to work    
around that would be to have another function similar to    
estimate_num_groups() which accepts a default value which it will    
return if it was unable to find statistics to use.  In this case, such    
a function could just be called passing the number of input rows as    
the default, which would make the costing code think each value is    
unique, which would not be favourable for caching.  I've not done    
anything like that in what I've attached here.  That solution would    
also do nothing if the ndistinct estimate was available, but was just    
incorrect, as it often is.    
    
    
    
There are currently a few compiler warnings with the patch due to the    
scope of the simplehash.h hash table. Because the scope is static    
rather than extern there's a load of unused function warnings.  Not    
sure yet the best way to deal with this. I don't want to change the    
scope to extern just to keep compilers quiet.    
    
    
    
Also during cache_reduce_memory(), I'm performing a hash table lookup    
followed by a hash table delete. I already have the entry to delete,    
but there's no simplehash.h function that allows deletion by element    
pointer, only by key. This wastes a hash table lookup. I'll likely    
make an adjustment to the simplehash.h code to export the delete code    
as a separate function to fix this.

Cache Overflows:    
    
    
    
You might have noticed "Cache Overflow" in the EXPLAIN ANALYZE output.    
This happens if a single scan of the inner node exhausts the cache    
memory. In this case, all the other entries will already have been    
evicted in an attempt to make space for the current scan's tuples.    
However, if we see an overflow then the size of the results from a    
single scan alone must have exceeded work_mem.  There might be some    
tweaking to do here as it seems a shame that a single overly larger    
scan would flush the entire cache. I doubt it would be too hard to    
limit the flushing to some percentage of work_mem. Similar to how    
large seqscans don't entirely flush shared_buffers.    
    
    
    
Current Status:    
    
    
    
I've spent quite a bit of time getting this working. I'd like to take    
a serious go at making this happen for PG14.  For now, it all seems to    
work. I have some concerns about bad statistics causing nested loop    
joins to be favoured more than they were previously due to the result    
cache further lowering the cost of them when the cache hit ratio is    
thought to be high.    
    
    
    
For now, the node type is parallel_safe, but not parallel_aware. I can    
see that a parallel_aware version would be useful, but I've not done    
that here. Anything in that area will not be part of my initial    
effort.  The unfortunate part about that is the actual hit ratio will    
drop with more parallel workers since the caches of each worker are    
separate.    
    
    
    
Some tests show a 10x speedup on TPC-H Q2.    
    
    
    
I'm interested in getting feedback on this before doing much further work on it.    
    
    
    
Does it seem like something we might want for PG14?
