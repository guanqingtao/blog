`pg_wait_sampling` – sampling based statistics of wait events  
=============================================================  
  
Introduction  
------------  
  
PostgreSQL 9.6+ provides an information about current wait event of particular  
process.  However, in order to gather descriptive statistics of server  
behavior user have to sample current wait event multiple times.  
`pg_wait_sampling` is an extension for collecting sampling statistics of wait  
events.  
  
The module must be loaded by adding `pg_wait_sampling` to  
`shared_preload_libraries` in postgresql.conf, because it requires additional  
shared memory and launches background worker.  This means that a server restart  
is needed to add or remove the module.  
  
When `pg_wait_sampling` is enabled, it collects two kinds of statistics.  
  
 * History of waits events.  It's implemented as in-memory ring buffer where  
   samples of each process wait events are written with given (configurable)  
   period.  Therefore, for each running process user can see some number of  
   recent samples depending on history size (configurable).  Assuming there is  
   a client who periodically read this history and dump it somewhere, user  
   can have continuous history.  
 * Waits profile.  It's implemented as in-memory hash table where count  
   of samples are accumulated per each process and each wait event  
   (and each query with `pg_stat_statements`).  This hash  
   table can be reset by user request.  Assuming there is a client who  
   periodically dumps profile and resets it, user can have statistics of  
   intensivity of wait events among time.  
  
In combination with `pg_stat_statements` this extension can also provide  
per query statistics.  
  
`pg_wait_sampling` launches special background worker for gathering the  
statistics above.  
  
Availability  
------------  
  
`pg_wait_sampling` is implemented as an extension and not available in default  
PostgreSQL installation. It is available from  
[github](https://github.com/postgrespro/pg_wait_sampling)  
under the same license as  
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/about/licence/)  
and supports PostgreSQL 9.6+.  
  
Installation  
------------  
  
`pg_wait_sampling` is PostgreSQL extension which requires PostgreSQL 9.6 or  
higher. Before build and install you should ensure following:  
  
 * PostgreSQL version is 9.6 or higher.  
 * You have development package of PostgreSQL installed or you built  
   PostgreSQL from source.  
 * Your PATH variable is configured so that `pg_config` command available, or  
   set PG_CONFIG variable.  
  
Typical installation procedure may look like this:  
  
    $ git clone https://github.com/postgrespro/pg_wait_sampling.git  
    $ cd pg_wait_sampling  
    $ make USE_PGXS=1  
    $ sudo make USE_PGXS=1 install  
    $ make USE_PGXS=1 installcheck  
    $ psql DB -c "CREATE EXTENSION pg_wait_sampling;"  
  
Compilation on Windows is not supported, since the extension uses symbols from PostgreSQL  
that are not exported.  
  
Usage  
-----  
  
`pg_wait_sampling` interacts with user by set of views and functions.  
  
`pg_wait_sampling_current` view – information about current wait events for  
all processed including background workers.  
  
| Column name | Column type |      Description        |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |  
| pid         | int4        | Id of process           |  
| event_type  | text        | Name of wait event type |  
| event       | text        | Name of wait event      |  
| queryid     | int8        | Id of query             |  
  
`pg_wait_sampling_get_current(pid int4)` returns the same table for single given  
process.  
  
`pg_wait_sampling_history` view – history of wait events obtained by sampling into  
in-memory ring buffer.  
  
| Column name | Column type |      Description        |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |  
| pid         | int4        | Id of process           |  
| ts          | timestamptz | Sample timestamp        |  
| event_type  | text        | Name of wait event type |  
| event       | text        | Name of wait event      |  
| queryid     | int8        | Id of query             |  
  
`pg_wait_sampling_profile` view – profile of wait events obtained by sampling into  
in-memory hash table.  
  
| Column name | Column type |      Description        |  
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |  
| pid         | int4        | Id of process           |  
| event_type  | text        | Name of wait event type |  
| event       | text        | Name of wait event      |  
| queryid     | int8        | Id of query             |  
| count       | text        | Count of samples        |  
  
`pg_wait_sampling_reset_profile()` function resets the profile.  
  
The work of wait event statistics collector worker is controlled by following  
GUCs.  
  
|         Parameter name              | Data type |                  Description                | Default value |  
| ----------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------: |  
| pg_wait_sampling.history_size       | int4      | Size of history in-memory ring buffer       |          5000 |  
| pg_wait_sampling.history_period     | int4      | Period for history sampling in milliseconds |            10 |  
| pg_wait_sampling.profile_period     | int4      | Period for profile sampling in milliseconds |            10 |  
| pg_wait_sampling.profile_pid        | bool      | Whether profile should be per pid           |          true |  
| pg_wait_sampling.profile_queries    | bool      | Whether profile should be per query			|         false |  
  
If `pg_wait_sampling.profile_pid` is set to false, sampling profile wouldn't be  
collected in per-process manner.  In this case the value of pid could would  
be always zero and corresponding row contain samples among all the processes.  
  
While `pg_wait_sampling.profile_queries` is set to false `queryid` field in  
views will be zero.  
  
These GUCs are allowed to be changed by superuser.  Also, they are placed into  
shared memory.  Thus, they could be changed from any backend and affects worker  
runtime.  
  
See  
[PostgreSQL documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/monitoring-stats.html#WAIT-EVENT-TABLE)  
for list of possible wait events.  
  
Contribution  
------------  
  
Please, notice, that `pg_wait_sampling` is still under development and while  
it's stable and tested, it may contains some bugs. Don't hesitate to raise  
[issues at github](https://github.com/postgrespro/pg_wait_sampling/issues) with  
your bug reports.  
  
If you're lacking of some functionality in `pg_wait_sampling` and feeling power  
to implement it then you're welcome to make pull requests.
