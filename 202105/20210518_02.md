## 背景    
结合PostgreSQL, MADlib, Tensorflow, plpythonu编程接口, 实现机器学习和时序分析.     
    
优点: 效率最高. 使用本地数据, 不需要move data.

integrate machine learning into our databases and showed examples using Apache MADlib and Tensorflow to analyse the Boston Housing Dataset.

In this blog mini-series, we'll take a deeper dive into the code I wrote to perform this analysis using Tensorflow. Whilst MADlib is certainly useful for building intelligent analytics into your databases, use of Tensorflow is arguably much more interesting as we can easily build whatever we want using pl/python3 as we'll have access to all the nuts and bolts of Tensorflow (or PyTorch or scikit-learn etc.) as well as virtually the entire Python package ecosystem which includes incredibly handy libraries such as Pandas and Numpy.

# Regression    
    
We can use Tensorflow from within PostgreSQL to perform regression tasks for    
modelling and prediction. Essentially we're using a neural network to learn the    
relationship between inputs and outputs; for example, given:    
    
x = y *[some operation]* z    
    
we're modelling *[some operation]*, essentially approximating the formula.    
    
Note that whilst in some cases there may be a specific, defined relationship    
between the inputs and outputs (e.g. x<sup>2</sup> = y<sup>2</sup> +     
z<sup>2</sup> - Pythagoras' theorem), in other cases there may not be. These    
are typically the cases that interest us as they allow us to analyse data for    
business intelligence purposes. A good example is predicting the price of a     
house based on factors such as location, number of bedrooms and reception rooms,    
type of build etc.    
    
## PostgreSQL    
    
### Tensorflow    
    
We need to configure PostgreSQL in order to run Tensorflow. This consists of a    
couple of steps:    
    
1. Install pl/plython3 in your PostgreSQL database, e.g:    
    
    ```postgresql    
    CREATE EXTENSION plpython3u;    
    ```    
       
2. Install Tensorflow (and any other required modules) in the Python environment    
used by the PostgreSQL server. In my case, that's the EDB LanguagePack on    
macOS:    
    
    ```shell script    
    % sudo /Library/edb/languagepack/v1/Python-3.7/bin/pip3 install tensorflow numpy    
   ```    
       
It should then be possible to create pl/python3 functions in PostgreSQL.    
    
### Apache Madlib    
    
Some examples use Apache MADLib instead of Tensorflow. See the documentation on    
the [MADLib Confluence page](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MADLIB/Installation+Guide).    
    
    
## Scripts    
    
There are various SQL scripts in this directory that represent the various    
experiments I've worked on. Most create:    
    
- A table to store training inputs and outputs.    
- A function to generate data for the training table.    
- A function to train a model and make a prediction based on that model.    
    
Obviously in real-world applications the model creation and prediction functions    
would probably be separated, and training data would likely come from existing    
tables/views.    
    
__Note:__ All files written by the scripts will be owned by the user account    
under which PostgreSQL is running, and unless a full path is given, will be     
written relative to the data directory. I've used */Users/Shared/tf* as the     
working directory; you may want to change that.    
    
### ohms_law.sql    
    
This attempts to teach a network a basic operation based on Ohms Law;    
    
voltage (v) = i (current) * r (resistance)    
    
It's worth noting that the results of this model are *terrible*, so don't try     
to use it as the basis for anything else. At the time of writing I haven't yet    
figured out why this is the case, though I have some hunches.    
    
### pythagoras.sql    
    
This attempts to teach a network Pythagoras' Theorem:    
    
x<sup>2</sup> = y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup>    
    
The square of the length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle is the     
sum of the square of the other sides.    
    
### random1.sql    
    
This attempts to teach a network a completely fictitious equation with five     
input variables (in pl/pgsql):    
    
 z := cbrt((a * b) / (sin(c) * sqrt(d)) + (e * e * e));    
     
 ### tf-housing.sql    
     
 This is based on the well known [Boston Housing dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html).    
 The SQL file contains the definition for a table to hold the data (loading it    
 is an exercise for the reader) and a function for training, testing and using    
 a model. This function differs from other in that Pandas data frames are used    
 in place of Numpy, and an attempt is made to remove rows container outliers     
 from the dataset before training, in order to increase accuracy of results.    
     
 ### ml-housing.sql    
     
 This script implements the same regression analysis as *tf-housing.sql*, except    
 that it uses Apache MADLib instead of Tensorflow.
