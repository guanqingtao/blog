## 背景   
PostgreSQL 17 preview - 引入新的smgr, 优化bulk loading 场景.  
- 对于restore大量relation, schema only的场景, 优化效果明显. (通过将fsync推迟到checkpoint)    
- 对于restore 大量数据(大表), 也有一定优化(通过一次性写入多个wal pages.)    
  
由于需要实现, 后续的commit可能会有实际的优化实现. 目前sorted GiST index build did that already.

Introduce a new smgr bulk loading facility.  
  
The new facility makes it easier to optimize bulk loading, as the  
logic for buffering, WAL-logging, and syncing the relation only needs  
to be implemented once. It's also less error-prone: We have had a  
number of bugs in how a relation is fsync'd - or not - at the end of a  
bulk loading operation. By centralizing that logic to one place, we  
only need to write it correctly once.  
  
The new facility is faster for small relations: Instead of of calling  
smgrimmedsync(), we register the fsync to happen at next checkpoint,  
which avoids the fsync latency. That can make a big difference if you  
are e.g. restoring a schema-only dump with lots of relations.  
  
It is also slightly more efficient with large relations, as the WAL  
logging is performed multiple pages at a time. That avoids some WAL  
header overhead. The sorted GiST index build did that already, this  
moves the buffering to the new facility.  
  
The changes to pageinspect GiST test needs an explanation: Before this  
patch, the sorted GiST index build set the LSN on every page to the  
special GistBuildLSN value, not the LSN of the WAL record, even though  
they were WAL-logged. There was no particular need for it, it just  
happened naturally when we wrote out the pages before WAL-logging  
them. Now we WAL-log the pages first, like in B-tree build, so the  
pages are stamped with the record's real LSN. When the build is not  
WAL-logged, we still use GistBuildLSN. To make the test output  
predictable, use an unlogged index.
