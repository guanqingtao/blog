## 背景   
pg_restore 17以前的版本在恢复binary格式pg_dump文件时, 仅支持两种提交模式  
- 1个大事务, 要么全部成功, 要么全部失败, 但是在恢复过程中, 需要对每个恢复对象持有对象锁.  
    - 恢复效率更高, 但是如果对象特别多, 可能撑满锁空间.   
    - 同时, 第一个被加锁的表也要到最后pg_restore结束才能释放, 如果restore耗时比较长, 这个表在恢复过程中也不能执行ddl, 容易出现冲突, 甚至雪崩(ddl堵塞等待, 再堵塞未来的任何想持有该对象任何锁的sql包括select).       
- 多个小事务, 每个对象一个事务, 例如每张表恢复完数据立即提交, 然后释放该对象的锁. 如果遇到错误的话, 会导致不一致, 因为有些对象的数据可能已经恢复了.    
    - 效率更低(特别是小表很多的情况, 提交需要持久化sync增加了 RT, 效率可能更低), 但是对象锁恢复完即刻释放, 即使对象特别多, 也不会撑满锁空间.  
  
PG 17 pg_restore 引入 `--transaction-size=N` , 支持N个对象封装为一个事务提交. 兼顾了效率以及持有对象锁的时长和空间.

Invent --transaction-size option for pg_restore.  
  
This patch allows pg_restore to wrap its commands into transaction  
blocks, somewhat like --single-transaction, except that we commit  
and start a new block after every N objects.  Using this mode  
with a size limit of 1000 or so objects greatly reduces the number  
of transactions consumed by the restore, while preventing any  
one transaction from taking enough locks to overrun the receiving  
server's shared lock table.  
  
(A value of 1000 works well with the default lock table size of  
around 6400 locks.  Higher --transaction-size values can be used  
if one has increased the receiving server's lock table size.)  
  
Excessive consumption of XIDs has been reported as a problem for  
pg_upgrade in particular, but it could be bad for any restore; and the  
change also reduces the number of fsyncs and amount of WAL generated,  
so it should provide speed benefits too.  
  
This patch does not try to make parallel workers batch the SQL  
commands they issue.  The trouble with doing that is that other  
workers may need to see the objects a worker creates right away.  
Possibly this can be improved later.  
  
In this patch I have hard-wired pg_upgrade to use a transaction size  
of 1000 divided by the number of parallel restore jobs allowed  
(without that, we'd still be at risk of overrunning the shared lock  
table).  Perhaps there would be value in adding another pg_upgrade  
option to allow user control of that, but I'm unsure that it's worth  
the trouble; I think few users would use it, and any who did would see  
not that much benefit compared to the default.  
  
Patch by me, but the original idea to batch SQL commands during  
restore is due to Robins Tharakan.

用法  
  
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/app-pgrestore.html  
```  
--transaction-size=N  
Execute the restore as a series of transactions, each processing up to N database objects. This option implies --exit-on-error.  
  
--transaction-size offers an intermediate choice between the default behavior (one transaction per SQL command) and -1/--single-transaction (one transaction for all restored objects). While --single-transaction has the least overhead, it may be impractical for large databases because the transaction will take a lock on each restored object, possibly exhausting the server's lock table space. Using --transaction-size with a size of a few thousand objects offers nearly the same performance benefits while capping the amount of lock table space needed.
