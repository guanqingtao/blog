## 背景          
视频回放: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1aq4y1U7Rm/        
        
场景:         
- 在正常业务使用期间, DBA、开发者、分析师在数据库中跑大查询, 某些大表采用了全表扫描.    
        
挑战:         
- 大表的全表扫描会占用buffer pool, 从而将shared buffer中的热数据挤出去, 导致其他业务的SQL变慢, 严重的导致雪崩.     
     
PG 解决方案:      
- [《PostgreSQL 大表扫描策略 - BAS_BULKREAD , synchronize_seqscans , ring buffer 代替 buffer pool》](../201804/20180414_02.md)    
- 超过1/4 shared buffer的table , 全表扫描会使用ring buffer (256KB)代替buffer pool  
- page 标记为BAS_BULKREAD, 优先淘汰出buffer.   
  
除了全表扫描, PG的bulk - write, vacuum都有类似机制:   
bulk - write 16MB ring buffer  
COPY FROM command.  
CREATE TABLE AS command.  
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW or REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW command.  
ALTER TABLE command.  
  
vacuum 256KB ring buffer.  
  
  
When reading or writing a huge table, PostgreSQL uses a ring buffer rather than the buffer pool. The ring buffer is a small and temporary buffer area. When any condition listed below is met, a ring buffer is allocated to shared memory:  
  
Bulk-reading  
When a relation whose size exceeds one-quarter of the buffer pool size (shared_buffers/4) is scanned. In this case, the ring buffer size is 256 KB.  
  
Bulk-writing  
When the SQL commands listed below are executed. In this case, the ring buffer size is 16 MB.  
  
COPY FROM command.  
CREATE TABLE AS command.  
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW or REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW command.  
ALTER TABLE command.  
  
Vacuum-processing  
When an autovacuum performs a vacuum processing. In this case, the ring buffer size is 256 KB.  
The allocated ring buffer is released immediately after use.  
  
The benefit of the ring buffer is obvious. If a backend process reads a huge table without using a ring buffer, all stored pages in the buffer pool are removed (kicked out); therefore, the cache hit ratio decreases. The ring buffer avoids this issue.  
  
  
Why the default ring buffer size for bulk-reading and vacuum processing is 256 KB?  
Why 256 KB? The answer is explained in the README located under the buffer manager's source directory.  
  
For sequential scans, a 256 KB ring is used. That's small enough to fit in L2 cache, which makes transferring pages from OS cache to shared buffer cache efficient. Even less would often be enough, but the ring must be big enough to accommodate all pages in the scan that are pinned concurrently. (snip)
