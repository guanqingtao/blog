分区append scan支持更多order by 分区key 需求场景.  避免merge append需要mergesort的额外计算.   
  
例如 list 分区, 如果分区可以有序(例如list某个分区内有多个value时, 只要能保证有序就可以用append scan). 也可以支持append scan for order by 场景了.

Allow ordered partition scans in more cases  
  
959d00e9d added the ability to make use of an Append node instead of a  
MergeAppend when we wanted to perform a scan of a partitioned table and  
the required sort order was the same as the partitioned keys and the  
partitioned table was defined in such a way that earlier partitions were  
guaranteed to only contain lower-order values than later partitions.  
However, previously we didn't allow these ordered partition scans for  
LIST partitioned table when there were any partitions that allowed  
multiple Datums.  This was a very cheap check to make and we could likely  
have done a little better by checking if there were interleaved  
partitions, but at the time we didn't have visibility about which  
partitions were pruned, so we still may have disallowed cases where all  
interleaved partitions were pruned.  
  
Since 475dbd0b7, we now have knowledge of pruned partitions, we can do a  
much better job inside partitions_are_ordered().  
  
Here we pass which partitions survived partition pruning into  
partitions_are_ordered() and, for LIST partitioning, have it check to see  
if any live partitions exist that are also in the new "interleaved_parts"  
field defined in PartitionBoundInfo.  
  
For RANGE partitioning we can relax the code which caused the partitions  
to be unordered if a DEFAULT partition existed.  Since we now know which  
partitions were pruned, partitions_are_ordered() now returns true when the  
DEFAULT partition was pruned.
