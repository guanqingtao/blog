Move InRecovery and standbyState global vars to xlogutils.c.  
  
They are used in code that runs both during normal operation and during  
WAL replay, and needs to behave differently during replay. Move them to  
xlogutils.c, because that's where we have other helper functions used by  
redo routines.

+ * logging).  To check whether the system is in recovery regardless of which  
+ * process you're running in, use RecoveryInProgress() but only after shared

+ * state. The tracked information might still be incomplete, so we can't allow  
+ * connections yet, but redo functions must update the in-memory state when  
+ * appropriate.  
+ *  
+ * In SNAPSHOT_READY mode, we have full knowledge of transactions that are
