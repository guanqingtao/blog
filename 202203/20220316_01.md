Wake up for latches in CheckpointWriteDelay().  
  
The checkpointer shouldn't ignore its latch.  Other backends may be  
waiting for it to drain the request queue.  Hopefully real systems don't  
have a full queue often, but the condition is reached easily when  
shared_buffers is small.  
  
This involves defining a new wait event, which will appear in the  
pg_stat_activity view often due to spread checkpoints.  
  
Back-patch only to 14.  Even though the problem exists in earlier  
branches too, it's hard to hit there.  In 14 we stopped using signal  
handlers for latches on Linux, *BSD and macOS, which were previously  
hiding this problem by interrupting the sleep (though not reliably, as  
the signal could arrive before the sleep begins; precisely the problem  
latches address).
