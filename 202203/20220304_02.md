## 背景        
pgpool-ii 4.3 增加了一些有价值的特性, 例如负载均衡时可以控制当所有standby都超过延迟阈值, 是否将SQL发送给最低延迟的standby? 参数控制当数据库收到shutdown或者terminate backend信号时触发failover? 支持PG 14的sql parser等等.   
  
详见release notes:  
https://pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Main_Page  
  
  
- Allow to choose the least replication delay standby node when selecting the load balance node.  
- Allow to specify the node id to be promoted in pcp_promote_node.  
- Allow to configure to not trigger failover when PostgreSQL is shutdown by admin or killed by pg_terminate_backend.  
- Import PostgreSQL 14's SQL parser.  
    - Major changes of PostgreSQL 14 parser include:  
        - Allow an alias to be used to a JOIN ... USING  
        - Allow DISTINCT to be added to GROUP BY  
        - New SEARCH and CYCLE clauses for common table expressions

新特性相关参数:  
  
1、prefer_lower_delay_standby (boolean)  
  
This parameter is valid only when delay_threshold is set to greater than 0. When set to on, if the delay of the load balancing node is greater than delay_threshold, Pgpool-II does not send read queries to the primary node but the least delay standby with backend_weight to greater than 0. If delay of all standby nodes are greater than delay_threshold or the primary selected as the load balancing node first, Pgpool-II sends to the primary. Default is off.  
  
This parameter can be changed by reloading the Pgpool-II configurations.  
  
2、delay_threshold (integer)  
  
Specifies the maximum tolerance level of replication delay in WAL bytes on the standby server against the primary server. If the delay exceeds this configured level, Pgpool-II stops sending the SELECT queries to the standby server and starts routing everything to the primary server even if load_balance_mode is enabled, until the standby catches-up with the primary. Setting this parameter to 0 disables the delay checking. This delay threshold check is performed every sr_check_period. Default is 0.  
  
This parameter can be changed by reloading the Pgpool-IIconfigurations.  
  
3、failover_on_backend_shutdown (boolean)  
  
When set to on, Pgpool-II detects a backend shutdown event by checking particular error code 57P01 and 57P02 on a session established between the client and backend. If it detects those error codes, a failover is triggered on that node. When this is set to off, Pgpool-II only report an error and disconnect the session in case of such errors. The default is off.  
  
If no client is connected, Pgpool-II will not detect the event even if the parameter is on.  
  
Please note that 57P01 is not only sent at a shutdown event, but also sent when the backend currently connected is killed by pg_terminate_backend or SIGTERM signal. This is annoying because it results in unwanted failover. To avoid this, turn off this parameter.  
  
Note: It is recommended to turn on the backend health checking (see Section 5.8) when failover_on_backend_shutdown is set to off.  
  
This parameter is available in Pgpool-II 4.3 or later. This parameter can be changed by reloading the Pgpool-II configurations.
