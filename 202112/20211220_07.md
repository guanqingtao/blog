#### 7、为什么有的SQL使用pg_cancel_backend, pg_terminate_backend都杀不掉? (不处理中断信号阶段(HOLD..RESUME中间), src/include/miscadmin.h)

```
src/include/miscadmin.h

/*****************************************************************************
 *        System interrupt and critical section handling
 *
 * There are two types of interrupts that a running backend needs to accept
 * without messing up its state: QueryCancel (SIGINT) and ProcDie (SIGTERM).
 * In both cases, we need to be able to clean up the current transaction
 * gracefully, so we can't respond to the interrupt instantaneously ---
 * there's no guarantee that internal data structures would be self-consistent
 * if the code is interrupted at an arbitrary instant.  Instead, the signal
 * handlers set flags that are checked periodically during execution.
 *
 * The CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS() macro is called at strategically located spots
 * where it is normally safe to accept a cancel or die interrupt.  In some
 * cases, we invoke CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS() inside low-level subroutines that
 * might sometimes be called in contexts that do *not* want to allow a cancel
 * or die interrupt.  The HOLD_INTERRUPTS() and RESUME_INTERRUPTS() macros
 * allow code to ensure that no cancel or die interrupt will be accepted,
 * even if CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS() gets called in a subroutine.  The interrupt
 * will be held off until CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS() is done outside any
 * HOLD_INTERRUPTS() ... RESUME_INTERRUPTS() section.
 *
 * There is also a mechanism to prevent query cancel interrupts, while still
 * allowing die interrupts: HOLD_CANCEL_INTERRUPTS() and
 * RESUME_CANCEL_INTERRUPTS().
 *
 * Note that ProcessInterrupts() has also acquired a number of tasks that
 * do not necessarily cause a query-cancel-or-die response.  Hence, it's
 * possible that it will just clear InterruptPending and return.
 *
 * INTERRUPTS_PENDING_CONDITION() can be checked to see whether an
 * interrupt needs to be serviced, without trying to do so immediately.
 * Some callers are also interested in INTERRUPTS_CAN_BE_PROCESSED(),
 * which tells whether ProcessInterrupts is sure to clear the interrupt.
 *
 * Special mechanisms are used to let an interrupt be accepted when we are
 * waiting for a lock or when we are waiting for command input (but, of
 * course, only if the interrupt holdoff counter is zero).  See the
 * related code for details.
 *
 * A lost connection is handled similarly, although the loss of connection
 * does not raise a signal, but is detected when we fail to write to the
 * socket. If there was a signal for a broken connection, we could make use of
 * it by setting ClientConnectionLost in the signal handler.
 *
 * A related, but conceptually distinct, mechanism is the "critical section"
 * mechanism.  A critical section not only holds off cancel/die interrupts,
 * but causes any ereport(ERROR) or ereport(FATAL) to become ereport(PANIC)
 * --- that is, a system-wide reset is forced.  Needless to say, only really
 * *critical* code should be marked as a critical section!      Currently, this
 * mechanism is only used for XLOG-related code.
 *

/*
 * ProcessInterrupts: out-of-line portion of CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS() macro
 *
 * If an interrupt condition is pending, and it's safe to service it,
 * then clear the flag and accept the interrupt.  Called only when
 * InterruptPending is true.
 *
 * Note: if INTERRUPTS_CAN_BE_PROCESSED() is true, then ProcessInterrupts
 * is guaranteed to clear the InterruptPending flag before returning.
 * (This is not the same as guaranteeing that it's still clear when we
 * return; another interrupt could have arrived.  But we promise that
 * any pre-existing one will have been serviced.)

下次遇到杀不掉的可以用pstack看看杀不掉的进程在干什么, 找找对应的代码是否能找到是不是调用了hold中断.
