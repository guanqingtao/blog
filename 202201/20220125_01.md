## 背景    
pg_basebackup 增强, 支持DB端压缩和压缩比选项. 此前已支持client compress:

Server-side gzip compression.  
  
pg_basebackup's --compression option now lets you write either  
"client-gzip" or "server-gzip" instead of just "gzip" to specify  
where the compression should be performed. If you write simply  
"gzip" it's taken to mean "client-gzip" unless you also use  
--target, in which case it is interpreted to mean "server-gzip",  
because that's the only thing that makes any sense in that case.  
  
To make this work, the BASE_BACKUP command now takes new  
COMPRESSION and COMPRESSION_LEVEL options.  
  
At present, pg_basebackup cannot decompress .gz files, so  
server-side compression will cause a failure if (1) -Ft is not  
used or (2) -R is used or (3) -D- is used without --no-manifest.  
  
Along the way, I removed the information message added by commit  
5c649fe153367cdab278738ee4aebbfd158e0546 which occurred if you  
specified no compression level and told you that the default level  
had been used instead. That seemed like more output than most  
people would want.  
  
Also along the way, this adds a check to the server for  
unrecognized base backup options. This repairs a bug introduced  
by commit 0ba281cb4bf9f5f65529dfa4c8282abb734dd454.  
  
This commit also adds some new test cases for pg_verifybackup.  
They take a server-side backup with and without compression, and  
then extract the backup if we have the OS facilities available  
to do so, and then run pg_verifybackup on the extracted  
directory. That is a good test of the functionality added by  
this commit and also improves test coverage for the backup target  
patch (commit 3500ccc39b0dadd1068a03938e4b8ff562587ccc) and for  
pg_verifybackup itself.  
  
Patch by me, with a bug fix by Jeevan Ladhe.  The patch set of which  
this is a part has also had review and/or testing from Tushar Ahuja,  
Suraj Kharage, Dipesh Pandit, and Mark Dilger.

Allow server-side compression to be used with -Fp.

If you have a low-bandwidth connection between the client and the
server, it's reasonable to want to compress on the server side but
then decompress and extract the backup on the client side. This
commit allows you do to do just that.

Dipesh Pandit, with minor and mostly cosmetic changes by me.
