## 背景     
  
pg_upgrade 需要将旧集群的元数据导入新集群, 此前需要更新文件名, 表空间和数据库oid. 虽然这些变化看起来很轻量, 但是由于文件名等发生变化可能导致问题, 保留与旧集群一致的relfilenodes, tablespace oid, database oid 可以带来如下好处:   
- (1) it makes troubleshooting pg_upgrade easier, since you don't have to do a lot of work to match up files in the old and new clusters,   
- (2) it allows 'rsync' to save bandwidth when used to re-sync a cluster after an upgrade, and   
- (3) if we ever encrypt or sign blocks, we would likely want to use a nonce that depends on these values.    
    
PG 15改进, 保留了与旧集群一致的relfilenodes, tablespace oid, database oid.

pg_upgrade: Preserve relfilenodes and tablespace OIDs.  
  
Currently, database OIDs, relfilenodes, and tablespace OIDs can all  
change when a cluster is upgraded using pg_upgrade. It seems better  
to preserve them, because   
  
(1) it makes troubleshooting pg_upgrade easier,   
since you don't have to do a lot of work to match up files in the old and new clusters,   
(2) it allows 'rsync' to save bandwidth when used to re-sync a cluster after an upgrade, and   
(3) if we ever encrypt or sign blocks, we would likely want to use a nonce that  
depends on these values.    
  
This patch only arranges to preserve relfilenodes and tablespace  
OIDs. The task of preserving database OIDs is left for another patch,  
since it involves some complexities that don't exist in these cases.  
  
Database OIDs have a similar issue, but there are some tricky points  
in that case that do not apply to these cases, so that problem is left  
for another patch.

pg_upgrade: Preserve database OIDs.

Commit 9a974cbcba005256a19991203583a94b4f9a21a9 arranged to preserve
relfilenodes and tablespace OIDs. For similar reasons, also arrange
to preserve database OIDs.

One problem is that, up until now, the OIDs assigned to the template0
and postgres databases have not been fixed. This could be a problem
when upgrading, because pg_upgrade might try to migrate a database
from the old cluster to the new cluster while keeping the OID and find
a different database with that OID, resulting in a failure. If it finds
a database with the same name and the same OID that's OK: it will be
dropped and recreated. But the same OID and a different name is a
problem.

To prevent that, fix the OIDs for postgres and template0 to specific
values less than 16384. To avoid running afoul of this rule, these
values should not be changed in future releases. It's not a problem
that these OIDs aren't fixed in existing releases, because the OIDs
that we're assigning here weren't used for either of these databases
in any previous release. Thus, there's no chance that an upgrade of
a cluster from any previous release will collide with the OIDs we're
assigning here. And going forward, the OIDs will always be fixed, so
the only potential collision is with a system database having the
same name and the same OID, which is OK.

This patch lets users assign a specific OID to a database as well,
provided however that it can't be less than 16384. I (rhaas) thought
it might be better not to expose this capability to users, but the
consensus was otherwise, so the syntax is documented. Letting users
assign OIDs below 16384 would not be OK, though, because a
user-created database with a low-numbered OID might collide with a
system-created database in a future release. We therefore prohibit
that.
