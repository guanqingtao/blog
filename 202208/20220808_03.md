## 背景           
首先了解一下聚合的过程,   
- tuples-trans func-final func  
- tuples-trans func-combine func-final func  
  
非并行模式的聚合流程大致如下：    
    
```    
循环    
sfunc( internal-state, next-data-values ) ---> next-internal-state    
    
最后调用一次(可选)    
ffunc( internal-state ) ---> aggregate-value    
```    
  
pg-xc 的聚合与并行类似 cfunc可以理解为combine func:  
  
```    
sfunc( internal-state, next-data-values ) ---> next-internal-state  # 这个过程是在datanode节点完成的. input 是该datanode节点上的所有行(一次1行的进行调用).    
cfunc( internal-state, internal-state ) ---> next-internal-state  # 这个过程是在coordinator节点完成的. input是datanode节点的最终结果.    
ffunc( internal-state ) ---> aggregate-value # 这个过程是在coordinator节点完成的. input是cfunc的结果.    
```

PostgreSQL 16的`ORDER BY / DISTINCT aggregates`性能优化解决了什么问题呢?    
  
```  
agg1(a ORDER BY a), agg2(a order by a,b), agg3(a order by c)  
agg1(distinct a), agg1(distinct a,b)  
```  
  
以上两种聚合场景, 在未优化前, 每一个聚合函数都要单独排序, 不使用索引. 性能是不是很差?    
  
PostgreSQL 16的优化方法比较暴力, 选出一种排序方法, 适合最多的agg, (可以采用索引). 如果覆盖的聚合排序数量一样多, 则选择第一种. 例如:    
  
```  
SELECT agg(a ORDER BY a),agg2(a ORDER BY a,b) ...  
  
would request the sort order to be {a, b} because {a} is a subset of the  
sort order of {a,b}, but;  
  
SELECT agg(a ORDER BY a),agg2(a ORDER BY c) ...  
  
would just pick a plan ordered by {a} (we give precedence to aggregates  
which are earlier in the targetlist).  
  
SELECT agg(a ORDER BY a),agg2(a ORDER BY b),agg3(a ORDER BY b) ...  
  
would choose to order by {b} since two aggregates suit that vs just one  
that requires input ordered by {a}.  
```  
  
结合采用incremental sort的例子. [《PostgreSQL 11 preview - Incremental Sort(排序优化)》](../201803/20180323_04.md)

Improve performance of ORDER BY / DISTINCT aggregates  
  
ORDER BY / DISTINCT aggreagtes have, since implemented in Postgres, been  
executed by always performing a sort in nodeAgg.c to sort the tuples in  
the current group into the correct order before calling the transition  
function on the sorted tuples.  This was not great as often there might be  
an index that could have provided pre-sorted input and allowed the  
transition functions to be called as the rows come in, rather than having  
to store them in a tuplestore in order to sort them once all the tuples  
for the group have arrived.   
  
Here we change the planner so it requests a path with a sort order which  
supports the most amount of ORDER BY / DISTINCT aggregate functions and  
add new code to the executor to allow it to support the processing of  
ORDER BY / DISTINCT aggregates where the tuples are already sorted in the  
correct order.  
  
Since there can be many ORDER BY / DISTINCT aggregates in any given query  
level, it's very possible that we can't find an order that suits all of  
these aggregates.  The sort order that the planner chooses is simply the  
one that suits the most aggregate functions.  We take the most strictly  
sorted variation of each order and see how many aggregate functions can  
use that, then we try again with the order of the remaining aggregates to  
see if another order would suit more aggregate functions.  For example:  
  
SELECT agg(a ORDER BY a),agg2(a ORDER BY a,b) ...  
  
would request the sort order to be {a, b} because {a} is a subset of the  
sort order of {a,b}, but;  
  
SELECT agg(a ORDER BY a),agg2(a ORDER BY c) ...  
  
would just pick a plan ordered by {a} (we give precedence to aggregates  
which are earlier in the targetlist).  
  
SELECT agg(a ORDER BY a),agg2(a ORDER BY b),agg3(a ORDER BY b) ...  
  
would choose to order by {b} since two aggregates suit that vs just one  
that requires input ordered by {a}.
