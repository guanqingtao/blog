## 背景  
PG 14以前, 当收集表是否需要vacuum或analyze时, recheck过程需要刷新staticstic, 如果表很多, 同时vacuum worker工作进程很多, 导致refresh statistics 暴露性能问题.   
  
例如CPU飙高.   
  
PG 14 判断是否需要刷新statistics, 避免每次recheck都需要刷新statistics.  提高性能.

Speed up rechecking if relation needs to be vacuumed or analyze in autovacuum.  
  
After autovacuum collects the relations to vacuum or analyze, it rechecks  
whether each relation still needs to be vacuumed or analyzed before actually  
doing that. Previously this recheck could be a significant overhead  
especially when there were a very large number of relations. This was  
because each recheck forced the statistics to be refreshed, and the refresh  
of the statistics for a very large number of relations could cause heavy  
overhead. There was the report that this issue caused autovacuum workers  
to have gotten “stuck” in a tight loop of table_recheck_autovac() that  
rechecks whether a relation needs to be vacuumed or analyzed.  
  
This commit speeds up the recheck by making autovacuum worker reuse  
the previously-read statistics for the recheck if possible. Then if that  
"stale" statistics says that a relation still needs to be vacuumed or analyzed,  
autovacuum refreshes the statistics and does the recheck again.  
  
The benchmark shows that the more relations exist and autovacuum workers  
are running concurrently, the more this change reduces the autovacuum  
execution time. For example, when there are 20,000 tables and 10 autovacuum  
workers are running, the benchmark showed that the change improved  
the performance of autovacuum more than three times. On the other hand,  
even when there are only 1000 tables and only a single autovacuum worker  
is running, the benchmark didn't show any big performance regression by  
the change.  
  
Firstly POC patch was proposed by Jim Nasby. As the result of discussion,  
we used Tatsuhito Kasahara's version of the patch using the approach  
suggested by Tom Lane.
