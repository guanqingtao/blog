## 背景  
quantile 1.1.7  
  
https://pgxn.org/dist/quantile/1.1.7/  
  
不过PG现在的版本内置分位计算效率已经提高了很多, 建议使用内置的聚合函数:

# Quantile aggregates  
  
This extension provides three simple aggregate functions to compute  
quantiles (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile). There are two  
forms of aggregate functions available - the first one returns  
a single quantile, the second one returns an arbitrary number of  
quantiles (as an array).  
  
  
## History  
  
This extension was created in 2011, before PostgreSQL added functions to  
compute percentiles (`percentile_cont` and `percentile_disc`) in 9.4,  
which was released in December 2014. Even after introduction of those  
built-in functions it made sense to use this extension, because it was  
significantly faster in various cases.  
  
The performance of the built-in functions improved a lot since then, and  
is usually very close or even faster than this extension. In some cases  
the extension is perhaps 2x faster than the built-in functions, but that  
may be (at least partially) attributed to not respecting `work_mem`.  
  
It's therefore recommended to evaluate the built-in functions first, and  
only use this extension if it's provably (and consistently) faster than  
the built-in functions and the risk of running out of memory is low, or  
when it's necessary to support older PostgreSQL releases (pre-9.4) that  
do not have the built-in alternatives.  
  
  
## `quantile(p_value numeric, p_quantile float)`  
  
Computes arbitrary quantile of the values - the p_quantile has to be  
between 0 and 1. For example this should return 500 because 500 is the  
median of a sequence 1 .. 1000.  
  
```  
SELECT quantile(i, 0.5) FROM generate_series(1,1000) s(i);  
```  
  
but you can choose arbitrary quantile (for example 0.95).  
  
This function is overloaded for the four basic numeric types, i.e.  
`int`, `bigint`, `double precision` and `numeric`.  
  
  
## `quantile(p_value numeric, p_quantiles float[])`  
  
If you need multiple quantiles at the same time (e.g. all four  
quartiles), you can use this function instead of the one described  
above. This version allows you to pass an array of quantiles and  
returns an array of values.  
  
So if you need all three quartiles, you may do this  
  
```  
SELECT quantile(i, ARRAY[0.25, 0.5, 0.75])  
  FROM generate_series(1,1000) s(i);  
```  
  
and it should return ARRAY[250, 500, 750]. Compared to calling  
the simple quantile function like this  
  
```  
SELECT quantile(i, 0.25), quantile(i, 0.5), quantile(i, 0.75)  
 FROM generate_series(1,1000) s(i);  
```  
  
the advantage is that the values are collected just once (into  
a single array), not for each expression separately. If you're  
working with large data sets, this may save a significant amount  
of time and memory (if may even be the factor that allows the query  
to finish and not being killed by OOM killer or something).  
  
Just as in the first case, there are four functions handling other  
basic numeric types: `int`, `bigint`, `double precision` and `numeric`.  
  
  
## Installation  
  
Installing this is very simple, especially if you're using pgxn client.  
All you need to do is this:  
  
    $ pgxn install quantile  
    $ pgxn load -d mydb quantile  
  
and you're done. You may also install the extension manually:  
  
    $ make install  
    $ psql dbname -c "CREATE EXTENSION quantile"  
  
And if you're on an older version (pre-9.1), you have to run the SQL  
script manually  
  
    $ psql dbname < `pg_config --sharedir`/contrib/quantile--1.1.7.sql  
  
That's all.
