## 一般搜索:  
- 标签: [标签]  
- 词组: "包括空格"  
- 标签+关键词: [标签] 关键字  
- 标题: title:关键词 title:"包括空格"  
- 内容: body:"包括空格"  
- 代码: code:"xxx"  
- 用户: user:me 搜索我发的内容. user:其他人 关键词  
- 排除: "xx" -"xxx"  
- 正则: x*yz  
  
- To search within specific tag(s), enter them in square brackets: `[maintenance] seat` searches for mentions of "seat" within the [maintenance] tag.  
- To find a specific phrase, enter it in quotes: `"flat tire"`.  
- To limit your search to just the title of a question, use `title:` followed by the search term. Likewise, search the body only (exclude the title) with `body:"phrase here"`.  
- To search only within code blocks: `code:"new"` to search code within posts for the word "new".  
- To search just your posts: `user:me training` searches all of your posts for the word "training".  
- To exclude results from a tag, term or phrase, prefix it with `-` in your query: `waffles -unicorns` finds posts that mention tasty batter-based breakfasts without including mythical creatures, while `[laurel] -[hardy]` includes only posts pertaining to the first half of the classic comedy couple.  
- Use wildcard searches to broaden results; add an asterisk (`*`) anywhere in the word, like `encour*` or `Ex*nge`.  
  
## 高级搜索  
  
score, answers, views 范围搜索:  
- `score:-1` or `score:-1..` will both return posts with a score greater than or equal to -1  
- `views:500..1000` or `views:500-1000` will return posts with 500 to 1000 views  
- `answers:..3` will return questions with 3 or fewer answers  
  
时间范围(UTC时区):  
- `created:` to specify when the posts were created  
- `lastactive:` for posts active in a specified time period  
  
绝对时间(UTC时区):  
- year only – e.g., `created:2012..2013` searches posts created from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013; `created:2012` searches posts created from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012.  
- year and month – e.g., `created:2012-04..2012-05` searches posts created between April 1, 2012 and May 31, 2012.  
- day, month, and year – e.g., `lastactive:2012-04-03` searches posts who were last active between 12:00 AM on April 3, 2012 and 11:59 PM on April 3, 2012.  
  
相对时间(UTC时区):  
- `1y`, `1m`, and `1d` are shorthand for "last year", "last month", and "yesterday" - e.g., if today is April 15, `created:1m` searches posts created between March 1 and March 31. (You can substitute any number for `1` to look back that many years, months, or days.)  
- Relative dates in a range (`1y..`) look back to the same date in the previous period - e.g., if you want to see all the posts active in the last three months, use `lastactive:3m..` On April 15, that will show posts from January 15 up to the most recently active. You can close the range as well: `lastactive:3m..1m`.  
  
用户相关搜索(谁posts, 书签, 喜欢的):  
- `user:mine` or `user:me` (or any user id) returns only your posts (or only the posts from whichever user whose id you entered)  
- `inbookmarks:mine` (or any user id) returns only questions that you (or the user whose id you entered) have bookmarked.  
- `intags:mine` returns only posts that appear in tags you have marked as favorite. (If you don't have any tags, this operator does nothing. For better results, update your preferences.)  
  
布尔过滤(是否标记为accepted, 是否包含accept的回答、是否包含code、是否有回答、是否关闭、是否被标记为重复、是否已迁移问题、是否锁住、是否有注意、是否是wiki的posts):  
- `isaccepted:` `yes/true/1` returns only `answers` that have been marked "accepted"; `no/false/0` returns only answers that are not marked accepted.  
- `hascode:` yes/true/1 returns only posts that contain code blocks; no/false/0 returns only posts that contain no code.  
- `hasaccepted:` yes/true/1 returns only `questions` that have accepted answers; no/false/0 returns only questions with no accepted answers.  
- `isanswered:` yes/true/1 returns only questions that have at least one positively-scored answer; no/false/0 returns only questions with no positively-scored answers.  
- `closed:` yes/true/1 returns only questions that are closed; no/false/0 excludes closed questions from the search.  
- `duplicate:` yes/true/1 returns questions that have been marked as a duplicate of another question; no/false/0 excludes duplicate questions from the search.  
- `migrated:` yes/true/1 returns only questions that have been migrated to a different site; no/false/0 excludes migrated questions from the search.  
- `locked:` yes/true/1 returns only locked posts (which have edits, votes, comments, and new answers disabled); no/false/0 returns only posts that are not locked.  
- `hasnotice:` yes/true/1 returns only posts with a notice shown below them; no/false/0 returns only posts that do not have a notice applied.  
- `wiki:` yes/true/1 returns only community wiki posts; no/false/0 returns only non-community wiki posts.  
  
或:  
- To combine results from multiple tags, separate the tag names (enclosed in square brackets) with the word "or": `[widgets] or [geegaws]` returns questions tagged with either tag.  
  
其他:  
- `url:"example.com"` searches for posts containing the url "example.com"  
- `is:question` narrows results down to just questions, and `is:answer` returns only answers. 问题、回答的内容中包括xx  
- `inquestion:50691` restricts the search to the question with id 50691. If you are searching using the search box on a question page, you can use `inquestion:this` to restrict results to the post you are already viewing.
